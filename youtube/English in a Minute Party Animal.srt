Welcome to English in a Minute.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,440
Most people enjoy going to parties.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,560
You get to be around friends, eat food, and maybe listen to music.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,180
But do your parties ever have animals?

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,180
Party animal.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,400
Hey Jonathan, are you as ready as I am for the weekend?

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,400
Oh yeah.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,200
I'm going to my brother's birthday party on Friday.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:32,760
My cousin is having her graduation party Saturday and I'm hosting the karaoke party on Sunday.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,600
Wow, you are quite the party animal, aren't you?

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,600
That's nothing.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,400
You should have seen me in college.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,320
A party animal is not an actual animal.

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,640
It is a person who really enjoys going to parties.

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:56,600
Most of their time is spent finding out where the latest and best party is going to be.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,920
And that's English in a Minute.

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,960
