Hello everyone, I am VThis class introduces a tool to everyoneCalled using Chord GPT to automatically help developersProduce commit managerOk, I will explain to you laterThree main points, the first one is why I writeCode GPTThe second one we introduce Chord GPTHow to useThen we will talk about the performance of my useOk, everyone should not be unfamiliar with Chord GPTThat is currently AI, AI GC, AI Generator, ContentAt present, when the red bomb is in the worldThe software development engineers all thinkHow to use Chord GPT to help us developThe entire software process or improve ourUse or environmentAnd I am here mainly to use Chord GPTTo help you write Git commit managerHow to write Git commit managerYou can refer to this articleThen I may put it in the following linkOk, I'm here, I'm using GoWritten a CL tool called Code GPTIf you like, you can share it with meIn fact, the main point is to help the software development engineerTo organize the development contentYou can see Code GPTProduce commit manager effectThat is, when you write all the codes todayYou have to write to organize the commit managerAfter you say what this function doesOr how do I solve this bugThen today you may think about how to goWrite this content that makes everyoneI was very touched when I came to checkThen we use Chord GPTWe use AI to help you see the wholeAfter the Git diff contentLet's help to automatically generate this messageYou see this is the bottom effectYou can see all my commands hereAll use this tool called Chord GPTHelp me generate itNot written by meIn fact, basically, 80% to 90% are correctBasically, you just have to slightly adjust yourselfYou can do the effect you wantSo basically if you areI've been sending other people's codes for a long timeI also hope that the commitment message you wroteIs helpful to the teamThis tool can help you improveReduce a lot of timeOk, why do we write Chord GPT?In fact, the GitHub platform has alreadyThere are many similar toolsWhy do you have to redevelop againThe first is cross-platformI need to use the fast-release and self-sufficient blockAvoid different platforms and install different environmentsThis is for developers who are unfamiliar with the environmentCan be easier to installThe second is that my future plan isThe following GitHub, Github, Bitbucker, etc.After sending the PRYou can automatically help through Chord GPTHelp you sort out the content of the codeAnd automatically leave a messageSo this toolSo my developer tool is not justLet developers generate their own commitmentsIn the future, I hope to be able toCan be integratedHelp to carry out the code reviewThe third reason is that in the futureI hope it's not just the open AI APIChord GPT APICurrently in the A9 APIOpenAI has been supportedOk, let's talk about the usage nowActually very simpleEvery time the output will beLinux Mac OS Windows downloadRelative executionYou just download it and put it in BinThen go to the OpenAI website and create an API keyThe first month seems to be free of $18But I think this is already cheapIn fact, every day you onlyNo matter how much you commitNow is Chord GPT 3.5 Turbo versionIt's actually very cheapSo basically you commit a message a dayLook at the amount of token he has seenActually less than a dollarPretty cheapSo everyone put the new version onBecause it's very useful for you to write a commitmentAnd you don't have to waste timeGo and sort out what you have writtenOk, after everyone has done itIn fact, you can use Blue to installWe can take a lookLet's take a look at this pageIt's easy for you to download from this releaseTo the corresponding executionYou can download the Darwin ARM64 and AMD DOSOr the Linux versionOr the Windows versionOr you can say you are very simpleIf you use MacYou can just use Blue InstallBasically Blue TabApple Boy/TabThen installThen the next step is how to useSetup your API keyThis is very simpleAfter producing your API keyYou can use it yourselfAfter you go to the export variableThen you will do the post-release self-releaseLet's see how to use it belowLet's take a lookLet's take a look at the current contentBecause he is hereI changed somethingThen we take a lookgit diffAfter you see me change thisLet's take a look at it nextHow to do itLet's reset it to the previous stateOk, next we have code gptThis command lineYou can hit hlpYou can see that he has a lot of commands to useThe first one is the commandHe will help you to auto-generate the command meshThen you can set your own commandsLet me introduce this a little bitThen you can also use the git hook method to do itThis is less usedIf you need it, you can also use itHe will help you install a git hookUnder your gitTo improve your command hookThat command hook is when you command every timeHe will automatically help you generate these messagesThen he has the most important functionHe can review your codeSo this will be introduced laterLet's take a lookBecause we are now in a stage stateThere is a cmd.goWhen this file has been changedLet's take a look at the contentActually, it's just aChange a const to aChange it to a self-defined branchThen we just use the code gptKamiIn this way, he will automatically useAfter the gpt 3.5 turbo versionNext he told you thatWhat is the summary of the kamiHe told you thatUpdating environment variablePreface for consistencyThen he told you thatThe content inside isI changed the github to inputChange the zone to the bottomThen after completionBasically, it will help you write a kami messageAutomatically help you kamiSo you seeYou are automatically changed to thisgoodIf you are to thisIf you are not satisfied with this messageYou can use another wayYou can go downThisThis is actually with your githubThe content is the sameYou will go to the last oneKami messageAfter we go downHe must executegpt 3.5 turbo versionAfter completing the commandHe will goChange a new messageGoodUntil you change toWhat you wantThe message you wantSo you can keep changingOf courseThis is the money that is linked to your calculation tokenSo you seeI told you hereYourHow much is the Pong token usedThen yourHow much is the Confession token usedThen the total token here is these two addedThat is the lastYou may have to pay the mostNow every 1000 tokens is 0.002 US dollarsThat is very cheapSo basically you every dayNo matter how much you useAlmost less than a dollarSo you can saveGo to the bank every dayMoney for drinksIn fact, you can save your money every dayHow much time is the time to Kami messageSo I think it's basicallyIt's pretty convenientWhat about the other parametersLet's take a look at the content of the websiteHow to useit is goodThen we can actually use a codeGpt to useConfession this paperTo save some environment elementsFor exampleOkay, I put the open API keyAfter writing inBasically, I don't have to go to the e-sport anymoreBecause it will directly occupy theThe e-converter under the home screenThe code of the code gptCode gpt.yamlGo write these parameters inThen it automatically writesSo basically you don't have to worry too muchThen againOpenAiIt has a parameterBase bottom line ulWhy is this parameter hereThe reason is thisYou see all companies nowAlmost all of thisOpenAi's website is blockedThen after blockingEveryone is crazyPretend for world policyFor world policyYou can go to thisChange the base urlThen I guessOpenAi should have found this problemWhen it was releasedHe told meHe can clickThen his base url can be changedSo you can change it to what you wantThen everyone can use this freeThen many people thinkThen my key was stolenWhat are you doingIf you don't believe it, just add it yourselfThen this is a Chinese developerAssumeThen he is a Dino developerOkay, then you can put someSome data to the developerAPI keyAnd your organizationAssume your accountThere are more than one organizationRemember to set thisOkay, then you may want to use the modelWhich oneThen you can use gbt3.5Turbo orYou need more tokensBecause gbt3.5His token value is409 tokensThen you change to gbt4Maybe you can use 8k tokensOr 32k tokensBut its cost isOne is 15 timesOne is 30 timesSo please be careful if you need to use itIf you just want to doCommendations and review codesGbt3.5's Terminal is very usefulThen in terms of languageYou basically use EnglishYou can change your commandintoChineseFinding Chinese and Chinese and Japanese are all possibleThe goal is to install these threeThen I wrote more hereA plus functionOr the sake method to do someSo you have to do theseIf you do these sake and pos, you canYou can connect this openAI UI through this methodThen it's time outThis time out is your commitmentIf you need to see a lot of your tokensSometimes openAI will be noisyBecause openAI is too muchSo sometimes it will be very slowSo you can just turn this time out highThen it's nextMissed tokenThis token meansWhen you replyThese words are also included in thisComposition tokenThen suppose you have your compression tokenIf it's not enough, you can increase it from hereDefault is 300But the main reason for adjusting this isBecause you need this when you are doing code reviewit is goodThen there is temperatureThis is the basic parameter of openAI0.70.0 between 0 to 2The higher you are, the more the answer isSo don't be too high and don't be too lowSo the answer is 0.7This is the parameter of everyone on the InternetThere is another one calledGIF UnifyI want to introduce thisYou can take a lookFor example, I put this inOk, that's itYou will see thatI have this GIF contentIt has the front three and the back threeList outThis is what Git predictsBut your GIF contentSo it looks like this in GIFWhat about your GIFIf you set this Unify to 0Basically it will only listWhat about this red and greenWe can tryBasically it has aThere is a GIF thingAnyway, this isThis parameter is basically adjustingYou can adjust itI want to see the front few rowsWith the back few rowsThe preset is three rowsSo basically you adjust thatWe give it to the tokenIf we give it to openAIYou can reduce the amount of tokenSo this is also a benefit of reducing the amount of tokenSo if youYour review content is very longBasically you can adjust it a littleYou can reduce some tokensBasically I think it can be set to 0becauseBasically openAI isThe front few and the back fewThere is no big impact on the entire answerSo basically I set it to 0Ok, then it's CoolistOk, I think this is also very, very usefulWhat is this thing used forSuppose you change somethingFor example, that package.jsonPackage isnpmnpm,conf,jsonThat's actually uselessOr in the GoFor example, this is the point of GoThis thing is actually uselessThen send it inOpenAI also occupies the amount of tokenSo basically I will choose thisSo if it's similar, it's like thisOk, let me think about itFor example, like thisI set it to 0diff unifyThen this is CoolistI set it, for example, you have test fileBasically, it's uselessWe don't give it to openAIWe don't give it to openAIBut it's in this commitWe can just filter it outBasically, these parametersSo this is what we just talked aboutIt can doCommit PreviewYou can also add PreviewPreview means that I don't putThis timeCommit on CommitCommit for youThen you basically have your stage fileStill thereThen this is to help you translateBasically don't use this functionDon't translate it into ChineseBecause the amount of token in Chinese is quite largeSo please use it carefullyThen this is what I just demonstratedIf you are not satisfied with the previous commitIf you are not satisfied with the messageIf you are not satisfied with the messageYou can always put this commandYou can always modify the last commitThen againBefore there was a user who told meHey, can you change the format of this commit?No problemYou can define this templateThere are a total of several parametersSummary PreviewSummary TitleSummary MessageYou can useSo you can add aTimbre StreamTo change this thingOr Timbre FireYou can set it upGood, I won't talk about the GitCall review is actually the same as Git commitJust that he doesn't help you make a commitHe helps you do call reviewThis is what it meansOk, then we are the sameLet's take a look at an exampleLet's say we look at this callOk, let's add a PHP fileOk, man.p hpOk, then we write it downOk, next we take a look at thisHow to use thisCall gptOk, we areAnyway, only reviewWe will review nextAfter reviewing nextHe went to see the content in this stage fileThen he started to do the review call changeThis is reallyHe needs to spend some timeThen you can spray these messagesActually, this thing is actually very usefulHe will tell you that he may have someSome ingressionsSo you have to go to verify your inputWhat is it withEnter the user's accountSo I think these tools are very usefulHe listed five points for youHe listed five points for youSo basically I hope this thingCan continue our software development flowEvery time the user sends a PRFor example, when your team colleague sends a PRI automaticallyFrom yourFrom your whole content of this commitTo do call reviewGive a summarizeThat's a summary for youIt's very useful for the developer himself to send a PRIt's very useful for the readerHe can see this firstHe can see thisThe reader will know thatHey, this is your whole codeWhat are you doingAnd what may be producedWhat problems are producedAnd what suggestions do you giveBasically, I usually hope to sayHey, he actually has someSome ingressionsThen you didn't fix itBut wait for you to fix itI'll go and see againNo problemSo basically I think the AI gives outThe suggestions are very, very usefulNot only inCode languageIn PHP, in any languageHe sees a lot of itBecause he almost finished reading the Github codeThat's 2021 dataThen I think thatThe whole model base is already very, very powerfulSo basically he can see that languageOK, this is the tool I'm going to introduce todayThen I think this is very usefulThen below isOK, now is China and Hong KongMost companies have strict control over the wholeSo this toolAnyway, I developed it beforeThe process function can be linked to the socketYou can visit OpenAI through the process methodOr if you have a base UIIf you have your own Jaffa or ProssIt's also possibleOK, if you predictI think the next step is the A9 OpenAIWhen it comes inIt will support A9 OpenAIBecause the biggest shareholder of OpenAI is MicrosoftMicrosoft also integrated this thingInto their A9 Cloud serviceSo basically, in the futureMost companies will not be able to go with OpenAITo do the connectionBecause he has no ability to sayHe won't take your data to doAny training actionBut Microsoft is on this sideIs able to sayWe will never take your codeTo do that trainingThis is to sign a follow-up contract with MicrosoftSo this is the path that the big company is going to takeOKI hope this tool will be helpful to you todayIf you likeYou can help me to like itAt presentI think there are quite a few people using itSo now there are about 300 peopleIf you likeJust help me introduce or promoteThank you alleveryone
