Hello, everyone, I am Buyi.This class will introduce a tool calledUse the TrueGPT Automation DeveloperCreate a coming messageI will explain the three important things later.The first is why the code is called "GPT"Let's introduce the TrueGPTHow to use itLet's talk about the latest one.I use the new one.OK, everyone should not be unfamiliar with TrueGPTCurrently, it is AI, AIGC, AI Generator, ContentAt present, when it comes to red-grinding machineAll the software development workers in the world are thinking aboutHow to use TrueGPT to help us develop the entire software processOr improve our environmentAnd I am most important hereUse TrueGPT to write the KitKartMessageHow to write the KitKartMessageYou can refer to this articleI will put it in the link belowI directly use the sourceThe source is called CodeGPTIf you like it, you can share it with meThe main point is to help the software developmentYou can see CodeGPT creates the KitKartMessage effectYou write the code firstYou have to write the KitKartMessageFor example, what does this function doOr how do I solve this bugYou may want to say how to write the contentLet everyone know when they checkAfter we have CodeGPTWe use AI to help you see the whole KitKartMessageWe help to automatically create this contentYou see this is the bottom effectYou see all the KartMessage hereAll use this tool called CodeGPTHelp me createNot meBasically, 8 or 9% is correctBasically, if you want to slightly tweak yourselfYou can do the effect you wantBasically, if you have a long time to enter the codeThat's also because I hope that the KartMessage you writeIs helpful to the teamThis tool can help you to reduce a lot of timeOk, thenI don't want to write CodeGPTIn fact, the KitKart platform has alreadySimilar tools like thisWhy do you want to re-develop itThe first one is the cross-platform platformI need to use the sourceTo avoid the different platforms and different environmentsThis is easier for developers who do not receive the environmentThe second one is that my future plan isThe next GitHub, GitHub, Bbac and other platformsAfter sending PR, you can automatically helpHelp to organize the content of KartMessageAnd automatically leave a messageThen this toolSo my development tool is not just a single developerCan automatically create KartMessageIn the future, I hope that the wholeCan be motivated to help to do the codeThen the third reason is that in the futureI hope it's not just an open AI APIThe current API of TrueGPTCurrently in Azure's APIOpen AI has been supportedNext, let's talk about how to use itActually, it's very simpleEvery time, the number of users will haveThe corresponding self-sufficiency file of Linux, Mac OS WindowsYou just need to send it to BINThen go to Open AI's websiteCreate an API keyEvery month seems to be free 18 dollarsBut I think this is already cheapIn fact, every day, you knowNo matter how much you pay3.5 turbo version is actually very cheapSo basicallyKartMessageLook at the token amount he has seenActually not even a dollarIt's quite cheap, so everyone's credit card is rightBecause for youIt's very useful to write KartMessageAnd you don't have to waste time toThe things you wroteOkay, thenAfter everyone is done, you can useWe can install itLet's take a look at this websiteOk, it's easyYou can download from this listTo the corresponding self-sufficiency fileYou can downloadThe answer for your AUN 64 and AMD 64Or Linux versionOr Windows version can beOr you can say that you are very simpleIf you use Mac, you canYou can use Blue installBasically, it's blue tabApple Boy's Latch tabThen installNext is how to useSet up your API keyIt's really easy to use itYou can continue to use it after you create your API keyYou just need to export this variableNext, you will do the post-sale thingLet's see how to use it at the bottomLet's take a lookLet's take a look at the currentCommunionBecause it's hereI changed somethingLet's take a look at the GIT leafAfter I changed thisLet's take a look at itLet's set it to3 statesNext we have a code GPTYou can play hlpYou can see that it has manyCami can be usedThe first CamiIt will help you to auto-johnThen you can set your own cameraLet me introduce this a little bitThen you can also use the GIT methodThis is less usefulIt will help you to set up a GIT hookUnder your GITUnder your GITTo change your Cami hookThen you can automaticallyGo to the message you sentThen there is a most important functionIt can go to the remote controlSo I will introduce it laterLet's take a look at itWe are now in a stage stateThere is a CNDI have changed this answerIn fact, it is toChange a constantChange it to aThe address of your own addressThen we use the code GPT CamiSo it will automaticallyUse GPT 3.5's turbo versionAfter that, it will tell youWhat is the summary of CamiIt will tell you the environmentPreface for consistencyThen it will tell youThe content inside it isI changed the GithubChange the weight to the bottomAfter that, it will write to youCami messageIt automatically sends you CamiSo you can see that you are automatically changedLike thisIf you are not satisfied with this messageYou can use another wayYou can go to thisThis is actually the same as your GIT CamiYou will go to the message of CamiThe message of CamiThe next step is to performGPT 3.5's turbo versionAfter that, it will go toChange a new messageUntil you change itThe message you wantSo you can keep changing itOf course, it will signThe money of your calculationSo you see here, I tell youHow much is your PON tokenThen how much is your compHow much is the token usedThen the total token is these twoThat's the last thing you want to payNow every 1000 tokens is 0.002That's very cheapSo basically you use a lot of money every dayAlmost not muchSo you can save every dayTo pay for the drinksHow much is your day savedCami message timeSo I think it's pretty convenientLet's look at the other parametersHow to useIn fact, we can go through aCode GPT to useVery hot time to set up someEnvironmental dataAfter I wrote down the Open APIBasically, I don't have toGo to eSports anymoreBecause it will directly occupyThe code GPTCode GPT.yamlWrite in this valueSo basically you don't have to worry about itThen openAIOpenAI has a parameterBasis, you are here nowWhy this parameter is like thisYou see now almost all companiesOpenAI's net worth is all blockedAfter that, everyone is crazyFullyÂÅá setFully PlasticYou can change this point to the best UII guess at the beginningOpenAI should have found this problemWhen the record is releasedHe told me that he canEveryone can change the best UISo you can change it to what you wantYou can use this freeMany people think that my key is stolenWhat are you doingIf I don't believe it, I can just go and add it myselfIt's a Chinese developerThen it's a Dino developerOkay, then you canSome dataAPI keyAnd your organizationThere are more organizations in your accountRemember to set thisThen you can use the model you want to useYou can now use GPT 3.5Turbo or you needA lot of tokens because GP3.5His token is the token of 409Then you can change it to GPT4Maybe you can use 8k tokensOr 32k tokensBut his fee isOne is 15 times, one is 30 timesSo please be carefulIf you need itIf you just want to do the terminalGPT 3.5 terminal is very usefulThen in terms of languageYou basically use EnglishYou can change your terminalTranslate into ChineseTranslate into Chinese, translate into Chinese and JapaneseThe point is to use these threeThen I wrote aPlastic function hereOr sake in the way of doing connectionSo you have been doing theseSake and PlasticYou can connect it in this wayThen it's time outThis time out is to assume yourYour token needs to look a lotSometimesOpenAI will be noisy because OpenAI is too muchSo sometimes it's very slowSo you just adjust this timeThen there is Miss TokenThis token is thatWhen you replyThese words are too sourIn this tokenIf you don't use the tokenYou can increase it from hereThe default is 300But the main thing is thatWhen you are doing code review, you need thisgoodThen there is also temperatureThis is the basic parameters of OpenAI0.70.0 to 0.2Then the answer will be more and moreSo don't be too high or too lowSo 0.7 should be the parameters of this networkThere is also a calledDiff UnifyI will add thisYou can look at itYou will see thatMy Diff Nino hasThe front and the back are all leakedThis is the thing that the Git predictedBut your Diff NinoSo it's growing in the DiffSuppose your Git DiffIf you put this Unify color as 0BasicallyIt will only leak this red and greenCan we tryBasically it has aThere is a Diff thingAnyway, this isThis is basically the adjustmentCan you think about itI want to see the frontHow many rows are there with the backThe prediction is three rowsSo basically you adjust itIf we send it to OpenAICan reduce the token amountSo this is also a good thing to reduce the token amountSo if yourYour Diff Nino is very longBasically you can adjust it a littleThen you can save some tokensI think you can set it as 0BecauseBasically OpenAILook at the front and the backThe whole answer is not very bigSo basically I set it as 0OKThen there is IsqulistI think this is very usefulWhat are you doingSuppose you change things such asPackage.JSONPackage isMPNThere is no use in thatOr in GOFor example, this GO GOThis thing is actually uselessThen send it to OpenAIAnd then the token amount is occupiedSo basically I will choose thisSo similar to thisOKFor example, like thisDiff UnifyThen IsqulistI set it for exampleYou have Taste of FireThat basicallyThere is no meaningWe don't want to give OpenAIWe don't want to give AI to lookBut it is in this token amountWe can just drop itBasically this is the parametersSo this is what we just talked aboutIt can doThe preview of the token amountYou can also download the previewThe first thing is that I don'tDo thisDo the token amount on the tokenHelp you do the token amountThen you basically have Stained FireStill inThen this is to write your wrong translationBasically don't use this functionDon't translate the code into ChineseBecause the token amount of Chinese is quite largeSo everyone please use itThen this isJust demoedIf you are not satisfied with the firstThe code content of the first cardYou can keep downloading this commandYou can continue to modify the last cardThen there is a user who told me beforeThis card content is a little bit different from the formatChange itNo problemYou can define this templateThere are several parametersSummary of PrefaceSummary of TitleSummary of MessageYou can use itSo you can download aTemplate StreamTo change these thingsOr Template FireYou can set it upOkay, it's not here to talk about the keyInstall and UninstallThen you canGet AddAfter these firesNext key cardIt will jump out of a windowThat is the window in the cardThen put the AIThe layer of the layer of AIGo downSo you see it's going to help you do the codeSo it's very simpleThen let's talk about a callingThat calling is not very easyIt's the same as the key cardJust say it doesn't help you do the codeIt helps you do the call reviewThat's what it meansOkay, let's do the sameLet's take a look at an exampleSuppose we let's take a look at this codeOkayLet's go to the PHP fileOkayClick on the frontHPOkayThen the sameLet's put the key card on itOkay, let's take a look at thisHow to use itCode to the PHPOkayWe areAnyway, just useReviewLet's do the next reviewOkayAfter the next reviewIt will go to the content in the Stage FireThen it will start to do the review code changeThen this is reallyIt needs to be spent a period of timeThen you can spray theseThese reviewsIn fact, this thing is actually very usefulThe reviewer told you that it may have someSome ingestionSo you have to go toTo verify your input and whatEnter the show as a cardSo I think theseThe tools are very usefulIt's five points for youIt's five points for youSo basically I hope this thing can be usedOurThe software is openEvery time the user posts a PRFor example, your teamThe team is posting a PRIt's automaticFrom yourFrom your cardAll the content in itGo to the code reviewGive a summarizeThat this summarizeIs very useful to youFor the developerIt's very useful to the developerThen for the reviewerHe can look at this firstHe can look at this reviewSummonYou know that youWhat are you doing with this whole codeAnd maybe someWhat are the problems in the firstAnd what suggestions do you giveBasicallyUsually need to sayHe actually has someSome ingestionThat's not youBut do you have to wait for you to fix itI'll go and seeNo problemSo basically I thinkThe suggestions given by AIAre very, very usefulNot just inCodeThe code is very muchBecause he almostI've finished looking at the gameThat's the data of 2021Then I think thatThe whole model baseHas been very, very strongSo basicallyHe can look at the languageOkayThat's what I'm going to introduce todayI think this is very usefulThen below is thatOkayThen now it's China and Hong KongActuallyMost companies are strict about the transparencySo this toolI just developedProcess functionCan be connected to the sakeYou can connect through the processOr go toAsk OpenAIOr if you haveIf you have a base UIYou can add a formOr pass itIt's okayOkayIf you expect itI think the next stepIs to open the whole of the ageAfter coming inHe will supportOpenAIHe will supportAge of OpenAIBecause OpenAIThe biggest share isMicrosoftMicrosoft is alsoThis thingCombined with theirThe whole age of the whole cloud serviceSo basicallyWe areMost of the companiesIt's impossible to go to the OpenAITo do the sameBecause he didn't have the ability to sayHe won't take your dataDo anyThe full-time workBut MicrosoftHe is in this areaIs having the ability to sayWe will never goWhere to goTo do thatThis is the right thingThis is to sign with MicrosoftThe contract after thatSo this isThe big company is going to go to the right placegoodI hopeI hope that the introduction of this toolIs helpful to everyoneIf you like itYou can help meGo to the new oneClick on the warAt present, in fact, I thinkThere are quite a lot of people using itSo now it's probablyMore than 300 peopleIf you like itJust help me introduce the goodsPromoteThank you all
