Hello, everyone, I am BuiThis class can introduce a tool calledUse the TrueGPT Automation DevelopmentalCreate a coming messageI will explain to you laterThe first is why is the code GBTLet's introduce the TrueGPTHow to useLet's talk about the latest oneI use the new oneOK, everyone should not be unfamiliar with TrueGPTCurrently, it is AI, AIGC, AI Generator, ContentAt present, when the red bomb is usedAll the software development workers in the world are thinking aboutHow to use TrueGPT to help us develop the entire softwareOr improve ourUse or environmentAnd I am here mainly to use TrueGPT to help you writeKit Carman ManagerHow to write the Kit Carman ManagerYou can refer to this articleThen I will put it in the link belowOK, I am hereI directly use the source written in the CELThe code GBTIf you like it, you can share it with meThe main point is to help the softwareThe software is to organize the development contentYou can see the code GBTThe effect of creating Carman ManagerThat is, you write the code you wrote todayYou have to write to organize Carman ManagerFor example, what does this function doOr how to solve this bugThen you may want to say how toWrite the contentLet everyone check it out laterVery goodThen we have no code GBTI didn't use AI to help you to see the wholeKit different contentAfter that, we help to automatically create theseYou see this is the effect belowYou see all of my cards hereAll use this tool called code GBTHelp me produce it, but not meThat's basically what 8 or 9 are all rightThat's basically what you want to doJust go to do what you wantSo basically if you areIt takes a long time to write the codeThen it's alsoI hope you write it yourselfCarman Manager is helpful to the teamThis tool can help you toIt takes a lot of time to improvegoodI don't want to write code GBTIn fact, the platform of Github has alreadyThere are more similar tools like thisWhy do you want to re-develop itThe first one is the cross-platform platformI need to use the source of the cross-platform platform to avoid the different platforms and different environmentsThe second one is the future planningThe next Github, Github, Bbac and other Github platformsAfter sending PR, you can use the chatGbt to help you to organize the content of CarmanAnd automatically leave a messageSo this toolSo my development tool is not justLet the developer be able to produce Carman ManagerI hope in the futureCan help the whole team to do the code reviewThe third reason is that in the futureI hope it's not just the open AI APIThe Gbt APICurrently in the A9 APIOpen AI has been supportedOkay, let's talk about how to use itActually, it's very simpleThere will be a Linux Mac OS Windows every timeDownload the corresponding execution fileYou just need to download it and send it to BINThen go to the open AI website and create an API keyThe first month seems to be free 18 USDBut I think this is already cheapIn fact, every day you justNo matter how much you have, it is now a true Gbt 3.5 Turbo versionIt's actually very cheapSo basically youThe message of CarmanHe saw the token number, actually not a dollarQuite cheap, so everyone put it on the credit cardBecause for youIt's very useful for your writing Carman ManagerAnd you don't have to waste time to organize your ownWrite thingsOkay, then everyone can actually useUh, Blue to installWe can take a lookLet's take a look at this websiteOkay, it's easyYou can download from this listTo the corresponding execution fileYou can download theUse the blue installThat's basically blue tabApple Boy's tabThen installThen the next step isThe next step is how to useSet up your API keyThat's very simpleYou can continue to use it after you create your API keyYou just need to export this variableAfter that, you will go to do the post-production thingOkay, let's see how to use it in the bottomOkay, let's take a lookLet's take a look at the currentCarmineoOkay, because it's hereI changed one thing up hereThen let's take a look at the GIT leafOkay, look at meAfter I changed thisLet's take a look at what it's going to doLet's set it toThe third stateOkay, now we have code gbtThis CarmineoYou can play hlpYou can see that it has a lot ofCarme can useThe first CarmiHe'll help you to auto generate a Carmi MeshThen you can set your own CarmineoLet me introduce this a little bitThen you can also use the GIT hook methodThen this is less usefulIf you need it, you can also use itHe will help you to set up a GIT hookIn your storeThe store's GITGo to change your Carmi hookCarmi hook is that you will automaticallySend the message to CarmiThen there is one more important functionIt can go to the ReunitSo this is what David will introduceLet's take a look at itBecause we are now in a stage stateThere is a CNDThe structure is changedWe will open the contentOkay, in fact, it is to changeChange a constantChange it to aThe address of your own addressOkay, then we only use the code gbtCarmiSo he will automaticallyUse the 3.5gbt turbo versionAfter thatNext, he will tell youWhat is Carmi's summaryHe will tell youUp the environmentMarible Preface for ConsistencyThen he will tell youThe content in it isI changed the GitHubChange the inputChange the weight to the bottomThe small write is heavyThen after finishing itBasically write it to youCarmi messageYou automatically CarmiSo you can seeYou are automatically changed herelike thisgoodgoodIf you are not satisfied with this messageYou can use the same methodYou can go downThisThat's itIt's the same as your GIT CarmiYou will change the Carmi messageGoodWe will do it nextHe must be the newGPD 3.5 Turbo versionAfter thatHe will go to change a new messagegoodUntil you changeWhat you wantThe message you wantSo you can keep changingOf courseThis isSign up to the token you calculatedSo you seeHere I tell youHow much is your Pond tokenThen how much is your compAnd then hereTotal token is these twoThat's your lastYou may have to pay the maximumThen the next one isEach 1000 tokens is 0.002That's very cheapSo basically youNo matter how much you useAlmost not muchMore than a dollarSo you can saveThe money you save every dayTo order a cup of drinksIn fact, you can save a dayHow much you saveCarmi messageSo I think it's basicallyPretty convenientThen the otherLet's take a look at the websiteHow to usegoodIn fact, we can go through aCode GPDGo to use the compThis is the point of the chainTo set up some environmentFor exampleOkay, I wrote down the opaAfter writing it inBasically, I don't have to go to the eSport anymoreBecause it will directlyThe store under the roofCode GPD storeCode GPD storeGo to write in these settingsThen it's automaticSo basically you don't have to go to the sign upThen what aboutOpenAIOpenAI has a windowBaseThis is the reason why this windowThe reason is thatYou see all the companies nowAlmost all the companies in the networkOpenAI's network is blockedAfter thatEveryone is crazyThe fakeForward proxyThen you can change the forward proxyYou can change this pointThe best UIThen I guess at the beginningOpenAI should haveFound this problemJust when the file is outHe told me that he canEveryone's best UI can be changedSo you can change itWhat you wantThen everyone can use this freeMany people say thatWhat if my key is stolenIf I don't believe it, I'll just go and fake it myselfThen this is a Chinese developerThe priceThen he is a Dino developerOkThen you can put someSome dataWrite downAPI keyAnd your organizationJust assume that your accountThere are more organizationsRemember to set thisOkThen you can use the model you want to useThen you can use GPD 3.5 nowTurboOr you need a larger tokenBecause GPD 3.5His token is the token of 409Then you can go to GPD 4Maybe you can use 8K tokenOr 32K tokenBut his cost isOne is 15 timesOne is 30 timesSo everyone, be careful to use itIf you need itBut basicallyIf you just want to doThe card versionIf you use GPD 3.5The terminal is very, very usefulThen in terms of languageYou basically use it nowEnglishYou can change your card versionChineseChineseChineseChineseYou can put it hereAnd then I have one morePlask function or Sakir!It's a link, so you're doing these Sakir and PlaskYou can vote for this way to link this OpenAI UIand then it's timeoutThis timeout is to pretend that yourYour token needs to look very muchSometimes OpenAI will be noisy because there is too much of OpenAISo sometimes it will be very slowSo you just turn this type of highThen there is Miss TokenThis token is thatWhen you replyThese words are too sourIs it in this compression token?If you don't use this token, you can increase it from hereThe default is 300But the main reason for adjusting this isBecause you need this when you are doing code reviewsgoodThen there is TemperatureThis is the basic OpenAI parameters0.70.0 to 0.2Then the higher the answer, the higher the answerSo don't be too high or too lowSo 0.7 should be the parameters of this networkThere is another calledDiff UnifyThis thingI'll cut thisYou can look at itSometimes I put thisOk, this is goodYou will see that my Diff Nino hasThe front and the back are all leakedThis is the thing that Git predictedBut your Diff NinoSo it's like this in the DiffIf your Git DiffIf you set this Unify to 0BasicallyIt will only leak this red and greenCan we try itOk, basically it has aThere is a Diff thingAnyway, this isThis is basically the adjustmentCan you think about it?He adjusts itDo I want to see the front rowAnd the back rowThe prediction is 3 rowsSo basically you adjust itWe send it to tokenWe send it to OpenAIYou can reduce the token amountSo this is also the benefit of reducing the token amountSo if yourYour Diff Nino is very longBasically you can adjust it a little bitIt will save some tokensThen basically I think you can set it to 0BecauseBasicallyOpenAI is looking at the front and the backThe whole answer is not very bigSo basically I set it to 0OkThen there is IsqulisOk, I think this is very usefulThen what does this thing doSuppose you change thingsFor example, that kind of packagePoint decisionOr packageThat isNPNNPNConfirmation of the decisionThat actually has no useOr the structure insideFor example, this structureThe point of the structureThis thing is actually no useThen send it toOpenAI and set the token amountSo basically I will choose thisSo if it's similar, it's like thisOkFor example, like thisI set it to 0DefunifyThen IsqulisI set itFor example, you have Taste of FireThat basically doesn't mean anythingWe don't want to give OpenAIWe don't want to give AI to lookBut it's in this cardIn the cardWe just drop itBasically this is the parametersSo this is what we just talked aboutIt's that it can doThe preview of the cardYou can also download the previewThe first thing is that I don'tDo thisDo the card on the cardHelp you do the cardThen you basically have Stained FireStill hereThen this is the translation of the scriptThen basically don't use this functionDon't translate it into ChineseBecause the token amount of Chinese is quite largeSo everyone please use it carefullyThen this isJust demoedIf you are not satisfied with the first card contentOf the messageIf you are not satisfiedYou can keep downloading this commandYou can continue to modify the last cardThen there was a user beforeTell meThis card content is a little bit differentNo problemYou can define this templateThen there are a few parametersSummary of PrefaceSummary of TitleSummary of MessageYou can use itSo you can download aTemplate StreamTo change these thingsOr Template FireYou can set it upOK, the script is not hereIt's very simpleInstallAnd UninstallThen you sayGetAdderThese fireIn the next Git cardIt will jump out of a windowIs the window in the cardThen download the AI-shaped cardWater to youSo you see it's going to generateIt's going to help you do the cardSo it's very simpleThen finally let's talk about a call reviewThat call review is easyIt's the same as the Git card reviewJust say it doesn't help you do the cardIt helps you do the call reviewThat's what it meansOK, let's do the sameLet's take a look at an exampleSuppose we let's take a look at this codeOKLet's go to the PHP fileOK.phpOKThe sameLet's put the script onOK, let's take a look at thisThisHow to use.phpCodeGPDOKWe areAnyway, just useReviewWe will next reviewOKNext review is the sameHe will go to see the content in this stage fileThen he starts to doReviewCodeChangeThen thisHe needs to spend a period of timeThen you can spray theseThese informationIn fact, this thing is actually very usefulIn the beginning, he told you that he may have someSome ingestionSo you have toGo to verify the inputWhat are you doingEnter the user cardSo I think theseThe tools are very usefulHe made 5 points for youHe made 5 points for youSo basicallyI hope this thing can continue ourRuntyCoverFloorEvery time the user posts prFor example, your teamThe team is posting prI automaticallyFrom yourFrom your this cardAll of the contentGo to the code reviewGive a summarizedThat summarizedFor youVery usefulFor the developerIt is very useful to the developerThen for the reviewerHe can look at this firstHe can look at this reviewSummonedYou know that youWhat are you doing with this whole codeAnd maybeWhat are the problemsWhat are the problemsAnd what suggestionsBasicallyUsually need to sayHe actually has someSome ingestionThat's not youBut wait for you to fix itI'll go and seeNo problemSo basicallyI think the suggestionsThe suggestions are very, very goodNot just inCodeBecause he almostI've finished watching the gameThat's the 2021 dataI think thatThe whole model baseHas been very, very strongSo basicallyHe can look at the languagegoodThat's what I'm going to introduce todayThen I think it's very usefulThat's belowgoodThat's China and Hong KongIn fact, most companiesAre strict with the CFCSo this toolI've just developedProcessing functionYou can connect with the SackyYou can use the processOr visit OpenAIOr if you haveIf you have a base UIYou have a Java or a proxyIt's okayWell, if you expectI think the next stepIs the OpenAIOpenAIAfter coming inHe will also supportOpenAIBecause OpenAIThe biggest share is softwareThen Microsoft alsoThis thing is integratedInto theirThe entire cloud service of AgileSo basicallyIn terms ofMost of the companiesIt's impossible toGo to OpenAIBecause he didn't have the abilityHe won't take your dataDo anyThe training toolBut MicrosoftHe isThis is a possibilityI heardWe will neverGo to the codeDo thatThe right thingThis is to sign with MicrosoftThe contract laterSo this is theThe big company is going to goOkI hopeI hope to introduce this tool todayIs helpful to everyoneIf you like itYou can help me to click on the heartClick on the warAt present, I think it'sA lot of people are using itSo now it's about 300More people are standingIf you like itJust help me introduce the propaganda
