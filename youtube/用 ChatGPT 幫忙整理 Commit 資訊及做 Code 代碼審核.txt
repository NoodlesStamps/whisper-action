Hello, everyone, I am BuyiThis class will introduce a tool calledUse the TrueGPT automatic developmentCreate a coming messageI will explain three important things laterThe first is why the model is called GBTLet's introduce the TrueGPTHow to useLet's talk about the latest oneI used the new oneOKEveryone is not unfamiliar with TrueGPTCurrently, it is AI, AIGC, AI generator contentAt present, when the red bomb machineAll the software development in the world is thinking aboutHow to use TrueGPT to help us develop the entire software processOr improve ourUse or environmentAnd I am hereThe most important thing is to use TrueGPT to help you writeKitKamiMessageHow to write KitKamiMessageYou can refer to this articleThen I will probably put it belowOKI am hereI directly use the structureWrite a CEO to provide a code GBTIf you like it, you can share it with meThe most important thing is to help the softwareThe software control is to organize the contentYou can see the effect of code GBTCreate KitKamiMessageThat is, you write the code todayYou have to organize KitKamiMessageFor example, what does this function doOr this bugHow to solve itThen you may want to sayHow to write this contentLet everyone check it laterVery goodThen we don't have code GBTWe use AI to help you to see the whole KitKamiMessageWe help to automatically create this contentYou see this is the bottom effectYou see all of my KamiMessageAll use this set of tools called code GBTHelp me createNot meThat's basically89% is correctThat's basicallyYou just have to slightly adjust yourselfYou can do what you wantSo basically if you areLong time in the code for othersThat's alsoI hope you write your own KamiMessageIf you have any helpThis tool can help you to improveThere are many timesgoodThenI don't write code GBTIn fact, there are already more than this kind of tools on the GitHub platformWhy do you want to re-develop itThe first one is the cross-platform platformI need to use the source of the code to distribute it to the private sectorTo avoid the different platformsThe different environmentsThis is easier for developers who do not receive the environmentThe second one is that my future plans are to sayAfter the GitHub, the Git, the Bbac and other Git platformsAfter sending PR, you can use the chat GBTHelp you to organize the content of KamiMessageAnd the chatThen this toolSo my development tool is not just for developersCan automatically produce KamiMessageIn the future, I hope that it canCan be a tool to help you to do the code reviewThen the third reason isIn the futureI hope it's not just the open AI APIThe chat GBT APICurrently in the A9 APIOpen AI has been supportedOkay, let's talk about the way to use itActually, it's very simpleEvery time there will beLinux Mac OS WindowsDownload the corresponding private sectorYou just need to download and send it to BIMThen go to the open AI websiteThen you can create an API keyEvery month seems to be free 18 USDBut I think this is already cheapIn fact, every day you knowNo matter how much you KamiNow it's a true GBT 3.5 Turbo versionIt's actually very cheapSo basically youKami's messageHe saw the token numberActually not even a dollarIt's quite cheapSo everyone put the credit card on itBecause yourFor your KamiMessageVery usefulAnd you don't have to waste timeTo organize your ownWrite thingsgoodThen when you finishActually you can useI don't want to go to InstaWe can take a lookLet's take a look at this websitegoodVery simpleYou can download from this listTo the corresponding private sectorYou can goDownload the answer64 with the ANDOr the Linux versionOr the Windows versionOr youVery simpleIf you use MacYou can useJust use Blue installBasically, just use the tabApple Boy's stage tabThen installThen the next step isHow to useSet up your API keyThen this is very simpleAfter you generate your API keyYou can continue to use itYou just need to export this variableThen you will do the back-up thinggoodLet's see how to use it at the bottomgoodLet's take a lookLet's take a look at the currentKamiMessagegoodBecause it's hereI changed one thingThen let's take a look atGITDIFgoodLook at meAfter I change thisLet's take a look at what he wants to doLet's set it toThe third stategoodNext we have code gbtThis KamiMessageYou can play hlpYou can see that he has a lot ofKami can useThe first KamiHe will help you to auto generate a KamiMessageThen you can set up your own KamiMessageLet me introduce this a little moreThen you can also use the GIT hook method to do itThen this is less usefulIf you need it, you can also use itHe will help you to press a GIT hookAt yourAt your pointUnder the point GITTo change your Kami hookThen you can automatically send the message to the user every time you use the KamiMessageThen he has the most important functionHe can go to the remote controlSo this is also introducedOkLet's take a look at itBecause we are now in a stage stateThere is aCNDThe code is changed by the answerLet's take a look at the contentOk, in fact, just changeChange aThe variable of the constantChange it to aThe order of your ownOk, then we just use the code gbtKamiSo he will automatically useGbt 3.5 turbo versionThen he will tell you what is the Kami summaryHe will tell you the variable of the update environmentPreface for consistencyThen he will be able to say that the content inside it isI changed the Github into inputChange the weight to the bottomThe weight of the textThen after finishing itHe basically wrote it to youA KamiMessageHe automatically changed itSo you can seeYou are automatically changed to thisOkOkIf you are not satisfied with this messageYou can use another methodYou can go downThisThen this is actually with your Github KamiThe content is the sameYou will go to change the Kami messageOk, we will do it nextHe must be doingGPD 3.5 turbo versionAfter that, he will go to change a new messageOk, until you changeThe message you wantThe message you wantSo you can keep changingOf courseIt's all signed to yourThe token moneySo you seeHere I tell youHow much is your Pond tokenThen how much is your Confirmation tokenThen the total token here is these twoThat's the last thing you want to payNow every 1000 tokens is 0.002 US dollarsThat's very cheapSo basically you use it every dayAlmost not muchMore than 1 US dollarsSo you can save every dayGo to the money to order a drinkIn fact, you can save a dayHow much is your KamiMessageSo I think it's basicallyPretty convenientHow to use other parametersLet's take a look at the InternetOk, then in factWe can go through a code GPTUse Confirmation tokenGo to set some environmental parametersFor exampleOk, I wrote the Open API in thereBasically, I don't have to go to eSport anymoreBecause it will directly winThe store under the screenConfirmation tokenCode GPT storeCode GPT storeThe answer is to write in these settingsThen it's all writtenSo basically you don't have to worry about itThen what about Open APIOpen API has a functionBaseUILWhy does this function have this functionYou see now all companiesAlmost all of thisOpen API's king is all blockedAfter that, everyone is crazyCrazy fakeFor all the plusFor all the plusYou can change this pointBase UILThen I guess at the beginningOpen API should haveFound this problemWhen the record is releasedHe told me that he can pointEveryone's base UIL can be changedSo you can change it to what you wantThen everyone can use this freeThen many people will sayHey, my key is stolenWhat are you doingIf I don't believe it, I'll just go and get it myselfThen this is a Chinese developerThe priceThen it is a Dino developerOk, then you can turn someSome data to the computerAPI key and your organizationJust assume that your account has more than one organizationRemember to set thisOk, then you can use the model you wantThen you can use the GPT 3.5 Turbo nowOr you need a bigger tokenBecause GPT 3.5Its token is a token of 409Then you can change it to GPT4Maybe you can use 8K tokenOr 32K tokenBut its cost isOne is 15 timesOne is 30 timesSo everyone, be carefulIf you need itBut basically if you just want to doCarman's Bureau and Review CodeGPT 3.5 TurboIt's very, very usefulThen in terms of languageYou basically have the languageYou can change your Carman's Bureau toChineseTranslate Chinese, sign language, and JapaneseThe purpose is to change these three typesThen I have a more writtenPlastic functionOr Saki's house to make linksSo youYou have been doing these Saki and PlasticYou can connect it in this wayThis is the UI of OpenAIOk, then this is the Type-OutThis Type-Out is to assume that yourCarman's BureauYour token needs to look a lotSometimesOpenAI will be noisy becauseOpenAI is too much to useSo sometimes it will be very slowSo you just adjust the Type-OutOk, then there is Miss TokenThis token is thatWhen you replyThese words are tooCompression TokenIf you don't use Compression TokenIf you don't use it, you can increase it from hereThat default is 300But the main thing is to adjust thisBecause you need this when you are doing the Code ReviewOkOk, then there is TemperatureBut this is the basicThe parameters of OpenAI0.70.0 to 0.2Then the higher you are, the higher the answerSo don't be too high or too lowSo 0.7 should beThis is the parameters of the networkOk, then there is a calledDiff UnifyThis thingI will introduce thisYou can look at itSometimes I put this commandOk, that's itYou will see thatMy Diffnet hasThe front and the back three are all connectedThis is the thing that the Diff is expected to beBut your DiffnetSo it looks like this in the DiffThat's what your Diff isIf you put this Unify as a 0BasicallyIt will only show this red and greenWe can tryOk, there is aThere is a Diff thing on the DiffOk, anyway, this isThis parameter is basically to adjustCan you think about it?He adjusts itDo you want to see the front row and the back rowThe prediction is three rowsSo basically you adjust itWe give it to tokenWe give it to OpenAIYou can reduce the token amountSo this is also the benefit of reducing the token amountSo if yourYour Ruminant is very longBasically you can adjust it a littleIt will save some tokensThen basically I think you can set it as 0BecauseBasically OpenAI is looking at the frontThese are the fewThe whole answer to the back row is not very impressiveSo basically I set it as 0OkThen there is the Is CoolistI think this is also very usefulWhat does this thing useIf you change thingsFor example, the package.jsonThe package isNPNNPNConfirDock.jsonThat actually doesn't use anythingOr the "go" in "go"For example, this "go go"This thing actually doesn't use anythingThen send it to OpenAIIt also saves the token amountSo basically I will choose this oneSoIf it's similar, it's like thisOkFor example, like thisI set it as "nima""diff unify"Then this "iscoolist"I set it as "nitetestify"That basically doesn't mean anythingWe don't want to give OpenAIWe don't want to give AI to lookBut it's in this "common""common.nl"We can just drop itBasically this is the parametersSo this is what we just talked aboutIt can do"common" previewYou can also drop the previewThe preview means that I won'tDo this "common.nl"Help you do "common"Then you basically"Standify" is still thereThen this is to help you translateBasically don't use this functionDon't translate the whole ChineseBecause the token amount of Chinese is quite largeSo everyone please use itThen this isJust demoedSuppose you are not satisfied with the message of the previous "common.nl"You can keep downloading this commandYou can continue to modify the last "common.nl"Then there was a user who told me beforeThis "common.nl" format can be slightly changedNo problemYou can define this "template"There are several parametersSummary of P-fixSummary of TitleSummary of MessageYou can use itSo you can download a"templar_stream"To change these thingsOr "templar_fire"You can set it upOkay, I won't talk about "key" hereIt's very simpleInstall and uninstallThen you can"git_add"After these "fire"Then download "git_cami"It will jump out of a window"common.nl" windowThen download the "common.nl" that "ai" is generatedSo you see it is generatedIt will help you do "common"Okay, so it's very simpleThen finally let's talk about a "call review"That "call review" is very simpleIt's the same as "git_common.nl"Just say it doesn't help you do "common"It helps you do "call review"That's what it meansOkay, let's see another exampleSuppose we come and take a look at thisOkayLet's listen to that PHP fileOkay"common.phe"OkayThen the sameLet's put the string upOkay, let's take a look at thisThisHow to use"call_gbt"OkayWe areAnyway, we only have"review"Let's just do the next "review"OkayAfter the next "review"It will go to see the content of this "stage file"Then it will start to do "review call change"Then this is probablyIt needs to take a whileThen you can spray theseThese detailsIn fact, this thing is actually very usefulThe "challenge"It tells you thatIt may have someSome "ingestion"So you have toTo verify your inputWhat is itEnter the "share"So I think theseThe tools are very usefulIt's got five points for youIt's got five points for youSo basically I hope this thingCan continue our"Renewing the software flow"Every time the user posts a PRFor example, your teamThe team is posting a PRI automaticallyFrom yourFrom your "Kami"All the contentGo to do a "call review"Give a "summarize"That "summarize"Is very useful to youIt's very useful to the developer itselfIt's very useful to the developerThen for the "review"He can look at this firstHe can look at this "review"Summarize you will know thatHey, youWhat are you doing with this whole "call"And what are the problems that may occurWhat are the problems that occurAnd what suggestions do you giveBasicallyUsually it needs to sayHey, he actually has someSome "intuition"That's not youBut do you want to wait for you to finishI'll go and seeNo problemSo basically I thinkThe suggestions given by AI are very, very usefulNot just in"call-review"In PHPLook at it from a distanceHe looks a lotBecause he's almost finished looking at the "keyhabagore"That's the 2021 dataThen I think thatThe whole model baseHas been very, very powerfulSo basicallyHe can look at the languagegoodThen this is the tool I'm going to introduce todayThen I think it's very usefulThen below isthatgoodThat's China and Hong KongIn fact, most companiesAre strict with the CPMCSo this toolI'm just going toJust develop the process functionYou can connect it to the Sacky methodYou can connect it to the Sacky methodOr goAsk OpenAIOr if you have a base UIIf you have a "for all possible"It's okaygoodThen if you expectI think the next step isOpenAI for AzureAfter coming inHe will support Azure OpenAIBecause OpenAIThe biggest share is softwareThat software is alsoThis thing is integrated into theirAzureThe whole cloud service is thereSo basicallyIn terms of usMost of the companiesIt's impossible to work with OpenAIBecause he has no ability to sayHe won't take your dataDo any of the full-time operationsBut softwareHe is in this aspectIs there a possibility to sayHey, we will never go whereCode to do thatThis is what we have to do with the futureSign the contract laterSo this is the big companyThe right way to gogoodI hopeI hope that the introduction of this toolIs helpful to everyoneIf you like itYou can help me to clickClick on the "subscribe"At presentActually, I think it's quite a lot of people using itSo now it's probably more than 300 peopleIf you like itJust help me introduce or promoteThank you all
