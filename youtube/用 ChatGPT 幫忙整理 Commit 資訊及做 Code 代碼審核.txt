Hello, everyone, I am Buyi.This class will introduce a tool calledUse the TrueGPT Automation DeveloperCreate a coming messageI will explain the three important things later.The first is why the code is called "GPT"Let's introduce the TrueGPTHow to use itLet's talk about the latest one.I use the new one.OK, everyone should not be unfamiliar with TrueGPTCurrently, it is AI, AIGC, AI Generator, ContentAt present, when it comes to red-grinding machineAll the software development workers in the world are thinking aboutHow to use TrueGPT to help us develop the entire software processOr improve our environmentAnd I am most important hereUse TrueGPT to write the KitKartMessageHow to write the KitKartMessageYou can refer to this articleI will put it in the link belowI directly use the sourceThe source is called CodeGPTIf you like it, you can share it with meThe main point is to help the software developmentYou can see CodeGPT creates the KitKartMessage effectYou write the code firstYou have to write the KitKartMessageFor example, what does this function doOr how do I solve this bugYou may want to say how to write the contentLet everyone know when they checkAfter we have CodeGPTWe use AI to help you see the whole KitKartMessageWe help to automatically create this contentYou see this is the bottom effectYou see all the KartMessage hereAll use this tool called CodeGPTHelp me createNot meBasically, 8 or 9% is correctBasically, if you want to slightly tweak yourselfYou can do the effect you wantBasically, if you have a long time to enter the codeThat's also because I hope that the KartMessage you writeIs helpful to the teamThis tool can help you to reduce a lot of timeOk, thenI don't want to write CodeGPTIn fact, the KitKart platform has alreadySimilar tools like thisWhy do you want to re-develop itThe first one is the cross-platform platformI need to use the sourceTo avoid the different platforms and different environmentsThis is easier for developers who do not receive the environmentThe second one is that my future plan isThe next GitHub, GitHub, Bbac and other platformsAfter sending PR, you can automatically helpHelp to organize the content of KartMessageAnd automatically leave a messageThen this toolSo my development tool is not just a single developerCan automatically create KartMessageIn the future, I hope that the wholeCan be motivated to help to do the codeThen the third reason is that in the futureI hope it's not just an open AI APIThe current API of TrueGPTCurrently in Azure's APIOpen AI has been supportedNext, let's talk about how to use itActually, it's very simpleEvery time, the number of users will haveThe corresponding self-sufficiency file of Linux, Mac OS WindowsYou just need to send it to BINThen go to OpenAI's websiteCreate an API keyEvery month seems to be free 18 dollarsBut I think this is already cheapIn fact, every day, you knowNo matter how much you have, it is TrueGPT3.5 Turbo versionIt's actually very cheapSo basically, you look at KartMessageHe saw the token numberActually not even a dollarIt's quite cheap, so everyone put the credit card on itBecause it's very useful for yourWrite KartMessageAnd you don't have to waste time to organizeThe things you wroteAfter everyone has finishedYou can use the blog to installWe can take a lookLet's take a look at this websiteOk, it's very simpleYou can download from this listTo the corresponding self-sufficiency fileYou can downloadThe answer for your answer64 and Andy 64 or Linux versionOr Windows version can beOr you can use MacVery simpleYou can use Blue installBasically, it's blue tabApple Boy's Latch tabThen installThen the next step isHow to useSet up your API keyIt's very simple, you can use it after you create your API keyYou just need to export this variableI'll do the post-sale thing nextLet's see how to use it at the bottomLet's take a lookLet's take a look at the currentKarmineoOk, because it's hereI changed one thingLet's take a look atGITLIFOk, look, I changed thisAfter we change it, let's see how itHow to do itLet's set it to 3Ok, now we have a code GBTThis KarmineoYou can play hlpYou can see that it has many KarmineoThe first KarmineoIt will help you to auto-jump the KarmineoThen you can set your own KarmineoLet me introduce this a little bitThen you can also use the GITHOOG methodThis is less usedIf you need it, you can use itIt will help you to set a GITHOOGUnder your pointUnder the point keyTo change your KarmineoThen you can auto-jump the KarmineoWhen you use KarmineoThen there is a most important functionIt can go to the remote controlSo I will introduce it laterLet's take a look at itWe are now in a stage stateThere is a CND.goLet's take a look at the contentOk, in fact,Change the variable of a consoleChange the variable of a consoleChange the variable of a consoleOk, let's use the code "gbt"KarmineoThen it will automatically use the 3.5 GBTAfter the turbo versionThen it will tell you what is KarmineoIt will tell you the "up the environment""Marable"Then it will tell youThe content inside it isI changed the Github to inputI changed the weight to the bottomAfter changing it, it basically writes to youKarmineoSo you can seeIt's automatically changed to this wayOk, if you are not satisfied with this messageYou can use the other wayYou can download thisThen this is actuallyThe same as your Github KarmineoYou will go to change the KarmineoOk, we will do it nextIt must be the 3.5 GBT turbo versionAfter that, it willChange a new messageOk, until you changeThe message you wantSo you can keep changingOf courseIt's all up to yourThe token amountSo you see here, I tell youHow much is your Pond tokenThen how much is your Karmineo tokenThen the total token here is these twoThen it's your lastYou may have to pay the priceNow every 1000 tokens is 0.002 USDThat's very cheapSo basically you don't care how much you use every dayAlmost not muchSo you can saveGo to save every day to pay the drinksIn fact, you can save a dayHow much is your KarmineoSo I think it's basicallyThat otherLet's take a look at the InternetOk, then in factWe can go through a codeUse Karmineo toSet some environment dataFor example, I wrote down the OPAPLAfter writing it downBasically, I don't have to go to the eSports anymoreBecause it will directlyUnder the screenCodeGPTCodeGPT.yamlGo to write in these settingsThen it's automaticSo basically you don't have to worry about itThen openAIOpenAI has a functionBaseThe line is hereWhy is this functionYou see now all companiesAlmost all of thisOpenAI's king is all blockedAfter that, everyone is crazyFor the policyFor the policyYou can change this pointBase UII guess at the beginningOpenAI should haveFound this problemWhen the recording is outHe told me that he canEveryone can change the base UISo you can change it into what you wantEveryone can use this freeMany people think thatMy key is stolenWhat are you doingIf I don't believe it, I'll go to the store myselfThis is a Chinese developerDevelopersThen he is a developer of DinoOkay, then you can put someSome dataAPI key and your organizationJust assume that your accountHave more organizationRemember to set thisThen you can use the model you want to useNow you can use the GPT 3.5Turbo or sayYou need a lot of tokensBecause GP3.5's token is the token of 409Then you can change it to GPT4You can use 8K tokenOr 32K tokenBut its cost isOne is 15 timesOne is 30 timesSo everyone, be carefulIf you need itBut basically if you just want to doThe card versionIf you use GPT3.5The terminal is very, very usefulThen the languageYou basically use it nowBecause of the languageYou can change your card versionChineseTranslate ChineseSignificance ChineseAnd JapaneseThe point is to use these threeThen I wrote aPlastic functionOr sakeTo make linksSo youYou have been doing these sake and plasticYou can use this method to connectThis open AIThen it's time outThis time out is to assume that yourYour token needs to look a lotSometimes open AIWill be noisy because open AIToo many people are usingSo sometimes it's very slowSo you just adjust this type ofThen there is miss tokenThis token is thatWhen you replyThese words are too sourIn thisThe token of completionThen if you have a complete tokenIf not enoughYou can increase it from hereThat default is 300But adjust thisThe most important thing isBecause you are doing code reviewNeed thisgoodgoodThen there is also temperatureTemperatureThis is the basicOpen AI parameters0.70.0 to 0 to 2Then the higher you areThe higher the answer isThe higher the answerSo don't be too highDon't be too lowSo everyone 0.7This is the number of people on the InternetThere is another calledDiff UnifyThis thingI will add thisYou can look at itSometimes I put thisOk like thisYou will see thatMy Diff NinoHe has put the front and the backAll outThis is the thing that the Git is expected to doBut your Diff NinoSo it's growing in the DiffThat's your Git DiffIf you set this Unify to 0BasicallyHe will only make thisRed and greenWe can try itOk, there is aThere is a Diff thingAnyway, this isThis is basically the adjustmentCan you think about it?I want to see the front rowAnd the back rowThe expected color is 3 rowsSo basically you adjustWe give to the tokenWe give to Open AIYou can reduce the token amountSo this is also the benefit of reducing the token amountSo if your Diff Nino is very longBasically you can adjust it a littleWill reduce some tokensThen basically I think you can set it to 0BecauseBasically Open AI is looking at the frontThe front and the backThe whole answer is not very bigSo basically I set it to youOk, then there is the IsqulistI think this is very, very usefulWhat does this thing do?Suppose you change thingsFor example, that kind of packageThe package isNPNNPN that confineThe function of the partyThat actually has no useOr the structure insideFor example, this structureThis thing actually has no useThen send it toOpen AI and set the token amountSo basically I will choose thisSo if it's similar, it's like thisOk, let's think about itFor example, like thisI set it to youDiff UnifiedThen this IsqulistI set it to youTaste of FireThat basically doesn't mean anythingWe don't want to give Open AIWe don't want to give AI to lookBut it's in this packageWe can just tear it offBasically this is the parametersSo this is what we just talked aboutIt can doThe preview of the packageYou can also download the previewThe preview means that I don'tDo thisMake a package on the packageHelp you make a packageThen you basicallyYou are still in the stagefireThen this is the translation you wrote wrongThen basically don't use this functionDon't translate the code into ChineseBecause the token amount of Chinese is quite largeSo please use it carefullyThen this is the demoSuppose you are not satisfied with the message of the previous packageYou can always download this commandYou can always modify the last packageThen there was a user before telling meThis package's format can be changed a littleNo problem, you can define this templateThen there are several parametersSummary of PrefaceSummary of TitleSummary of MessageYou can use itSo you can download a templateTo change these thingsOr a template fireYou can set it upOkay, the key is not hereIt's very simpleInstall and uninstallThen you canGetAdderAfter these firesThen download a key to the packageIt will jump out of a windowThat is the window in the packageThen download the package of AISo you see it's after this upgradeIt will make you a copySo it's very simpleThen let's talk about a calling viewThat calling view is very simpleIt's the same as the key's calling viewJust say it doesn't help you make a copyIt helps you make a calling viewThat's what it meansOkay, let's take a look at an exampleSuppose we look at this codeOkay, let's test that PHP fileOkay, .mphpOkay, let's put the file onOkay, let's take a look at thisHow to use thisCodeGPDOkay, we areAnyway, just useReviewLet's do the next reviewOkay, after the next reviewIt will look at the content in this stagefiringThen it will start to do the review code changeThen this is reallyIt needs to take a whileThen you can spray these messages in the next timeIn fact, this thing is actually very usefulIn the beginning, I told you that it may have someSome ingestionSo you have to go to verify your inputWhat is it? Enter the user's codeSo I think these tools are very usefulIt's five points for youIt's five points for youSo basically I hope this thing can continueOurRuntyCoverFloorEvery time the user sends PRFor example, your team is sending PRI automaticallyFrom yourFrom your codeAll the contentGo to the code review to summarizeThat summarizesFor youVery usefulFor the developerIt's very useful to send PRFor the reviewer, he can look at this firstHe can look at this reviewYou know that youWhat are you doing with your whole codeAnd what problems are happeningWhat suggestions do you haveBasically, it usually needs to saySince there are someSome ingestionThat's not youBut do you have to wait for you to fix itI'll go and seeNo problemSo basically I think the suggestionsThe suggestions given by AI are very, very usefulNot just inCodeThe PHP is very much seen in the languageBecause he almost finishedThe GitHub codeThat's the data of 2021Then I think thatThe whole model baseHas been very, very strongSo basicallyHe can see the languageOkay, that's what I'm going to introduce todayThat's very usefulThat's belowThat's goodThat's now China and Hong KongIn fact, most companiesAre strict with the PHPSo this toolI just developedProcess functionYou can connect with the Sacky methodYou can use the process methodOr visit OpenAIOr sayIf you have a base UIIf you have a Java or a proxyIt's okayOkay, then if you wantI think the next stepIs Azure OpenAIAfter coming inHe will support Azure OpenAIBecause OpenAIThe biggest share is softwareThat software is alsoThis thing is for the wholeWhen they areThe whole cloud service in AzureSo basicallyWe areMost of the companiesIt's impossible to go to OpenAITo do the sameBecause he didn't have the ability to sayHe won't take your dataDo anyThe full-time workBut the softwareHe is in this areaIs having the ability to sayWe will never take your codeTo do thatThis is to sign with the softwareThe contract laterSo this is theThe big company is going to the right placegoodThen I hopeI hope to introduce this tool todayIs to help everyoneIf you like itYou can help me to clickClick on the heartClick on the warAt present, I actually think it's a lot of people using itSo now it's probably more than 300 peopleIf you like itJust help me introduce the goodsPromote itThank you all
