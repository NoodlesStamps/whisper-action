00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, everyone, I am Buyi.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This class will introduce a tool called

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Use the TrueGPT Automation Developer

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Create a coming message

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I will explain the three important things later.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The first is why the code is called "GPT"

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's introduce the TrueGPT

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
How to use it

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's talk about the latest one.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I use the new one.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
OK, everyone should not be unfamiliar with TrueGPT

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Currently, it is AI, AIGC, AI Generator, Content

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
At present, when it comes to red-grinding machine

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
All the software development workers in the world are thinking about

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
How to use TrueGPT to help us develop the entire software process

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Or improve our environment

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And I am most important here

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Use TrueGPT to write the KitKartMessage

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How to write the KitKartMessage

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You can refer to this article

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I will put it in the link below

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I directly use the source

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The source is called CodeGPT

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If you like it, you can share it with me

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The main point is to help the software development

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You can see CodeGPT creates the KitKartMessage effect

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You write the code first

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You have to write the KitKartMessage

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
For example, what does this function do

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Or how do I solve this bug

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You may want to say how to write the content

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let everyone know when they check

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
After we have CodeGPT

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We use AI to help you see the whole KitKartMessage

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We help to automatically create this content

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You see this is the bottom effect

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You see all the KartMessage here

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
All use this tool called CodeGPT

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Help me create

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Not me

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Basically, 8 or 9% is correct

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Basically, if you want to slightly tweak yourself

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You can do the effect you want

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Basically, if you have a long time to enter the code

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's also because I hope that the KartMessage you write

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Is helpful to the team

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This tool can help you to reduce a lot of time

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Ok, then

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't want to write CodeGPT

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
In fact, the KitKart platform has already

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Similar tools like this

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why do you want to re-develop it

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The first one is the cross-platform platform

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I need to use the source

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
To avoid the different platforms and different environments

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is easier for developers who do not receive the environment

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The second one is that my future plan is

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The next GitHub, GitHub, Bbac and other platforms

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
After sending PR, you can automatically help

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Help to organize the content of KartMessage

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And automatically leave a message

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Then this tool

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So my development tool is not just a single developer

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Can automatically create KartMessage

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
In the future, I hope that the whole

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Can be motivated to help to do the code

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Then the third reason is that in the future

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I hope it's not just an open AI API

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The current API of TrueGPT

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Currently in Azure's API

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Open AI has been supported

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Next, let's talk about how to use it

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Actually, it's very simple

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Every time, the number of users will have

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The corresponding self-sufficiency file of Linux, Mac OS Windows

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You just need to send it to BIN

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Then go to Open AI's website

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Create an API key

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Every month seems to be free 18 dollars

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But I think this is already cheap

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
In fact, every day, you know

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No matter how much you pay

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
3.5 turbo version is actually very cheap

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So basically

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
KartMessage

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Look at the token amount he has seen

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Actually not even a dollar

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's quite cheap, so everyone's credit card is right

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Because for you

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's very useful to write KartMessage

91
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And you don't have to waste time to

92
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The things you wrote

93
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay, then

94
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
After everyone is done, you can use

95
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We can install it

96
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's take a look at this website

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Ok, it's easy

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You can download from this list

99
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
To the corresponding self-sufficiency file

100
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You can download

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The answer for your AUN 64 and AMD 64

102
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Or Linux version

103
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Or Windows version can be

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Or you can say that you are very simple

105
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
If you use Mac, you can

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You can use Blue install

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Basically, it's blue tab

108
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Apple Boy's Latch tab

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Then install

110
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Next is how to use

111
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Set up your API key

112
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's really easy to use it

113
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You can continue to use it after you create your API key

114
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You just need to export this variable

115
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Next, you will do the post-sale thing

116
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's see how to use it at the bottom

117
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Let's take a look

118
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's take a look at the current

119
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Communion

120
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Because it's here

121
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I changed something

122
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Let's take a look at the GIT leaf

123
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
After I changed this

124
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Let's take a look at it

125
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's set it to

126
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
3 states

127
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Next we have a code GPT

128
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You can play hlp

129
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You can see that it has many

130
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Cami can be used

131
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The first Cami

132
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It will help you to auto-john

133
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Then you can set your own camera

134
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Let me introduce this a little bit

135
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Then you can also use the GIT method

136
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This is less useful

137
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It will help you to set up a GIT hook

138
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Under your GIT

139
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Under your GIT

140
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
To change your Cami hook

141
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Then you can automatically

142
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Go to the message you sent

143
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Then there is a most important function

144
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It can go to the remote control

145
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So I will introduce it later

146
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let's take a look at it

147
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
We are now in a stage state

148
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
There is a CND

149
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I have changed this answer

150
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
In fact, it is to

151
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Change a constant

152
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Change it to a

153
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The address of your own address

154
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Then we use the code GPT Cami

155
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So it will automatically

156
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Use GPT 3.5's turbo version

157
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
After that, it will tell you

158
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What is the summary of Cami

159
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It will tell you the environment

160
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Preface for consistency

161
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Then it will tell you

162
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The content inside it is

163
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I changed the Github

164
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Change the weight to the bottom

165
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
After that, it will write to you

166
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Cami message

167
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It automatically sends you Cami

168
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So you can see that you are automatically changed

169
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Like this

170
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If you are not satisfied with this message

171
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You can use another way

172
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You can go to this

173
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This is actually the same as your GIT Cami

174
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You will go to the message of Cami

175
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The message of Cami

176
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The next step is to perform

177
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
GPT 3.5's turbo version

178
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
After that, it will go to

179
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Change a new message

180
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Until you change it

181
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The message you want

182
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So you can keep changing it

183
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Of course, it will sign

184
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The money of your calculation

185
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So you see here, I tell you

186
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
How much is your PON token

187
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Then how much is your comp

188
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
How much is the token used

189
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Then the total token is these two

190
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's the last thing you want to pay

191
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Now every 1000 tokens is 0.002

192
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's very cheap

193
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So basically you use a lot of money every day

194
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Almost not much

195
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So you can save every day

196
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
To pay for the drinks

197
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
How much is your day saved

198
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Cami message time

199
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So I think it's pretty convenient

200
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Let's look at the other parameters

201
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
How to use

202
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
In fact, we can go through a

203
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Code GPT to use

204
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Very hot time to set up some

205
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Environmental data

206
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
After I wrote down the Open API

207
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Basically, I don't have to

208
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Go to eSports anymore

209
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Because it will directly occupy

210
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The code GPT

211
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Code GPT.yaml

212
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Write in this value

213
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So basically you don't have to worry about it

214
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Then openAI

215
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
OpenAI has a parameter

216
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Basis, you are here now

217
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Why this parameter is like this

218
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You see now almost all companies

219
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
OpenAI's net worth is all blocked

220
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
After that, everyone is crazy

221
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Fully假 set

222
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Fully Plastic

223
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You can change this point to the best UI

224
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I guess at the beginning

225
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
OpenAI should have found this problem

226
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
When the record is released

227
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He told me that he can

228
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Everyone can change the best UI

229
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So you can change it to what you want

230
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You can use this free

231
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Many people think that my key is stolen

232
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What are you doing

233
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
If I don't believe it, I can just go and add it myself

234
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's a Chinese developer

235
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Then it's a Dino developer

236
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay, then you can

237
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Some data

238
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
API key

239
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And your organization

240
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
There are more organizations in your account

241
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Remember to set this

242
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Then you can use the model you want to use

243
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You can now use GPT 3.5

244
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Turbo or you need

245
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
A lot of tokens because GP3.5

246
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
His token is the token of 409

247
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Then you can change it to GPT4

248
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Maybe you can use 8k tokens

249
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Or 32k tokens

250
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But his fee is

251
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
One is 15 times, one is 30 times

252
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So please be careful

253
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If you need it

254
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
If you just want to do the terminal

255
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
GPT 3.5 terminal is very useful

256
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Then in terms of language

257
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You basically use English

258
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You can change your terminal

259
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Translate into Chinese

260
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Translate into Chinese, translate into Chinese and Japanese

261
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The point is to use these three

262
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Then I wrote a

263
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Plastic function here

264
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Or sake in the way of doing connection

265
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So you have been doing these

266
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Sake and Plastic

267
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You can connect it in this way

268
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Then it's time out

269
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
This time out is to assume your

270
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Your token needs to look a lot

271
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Sometimes

272
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
OpenAI will be noisy because OpenAI is too much

273
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So sometimes it's very slow

274
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So you just adjust this time

275
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Then there is Miss Token

276
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This token is that

277
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
When you reply

278
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
These words are too sour

279
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
In this token

280
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
If you don't use the token

281
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You can increase it from here

282
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The default is 300

283
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But the main thing is that

284
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
When you are doing code review, you need this

285
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
good

286
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Then there is also temperature

287
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
This is the basic parameters of OpenAI

288
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
0.7

289
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
0.0 to 0.2

290
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Then the answer will be more and more

291
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So don't be too high or too low

292
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So 0.7 should be the parameters of this network

293
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There is also a called

294
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Diff Unify

295
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I will add this

296
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You can look at it

297
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You will see that

298
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
My Diff Nino has

299
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The front and the back are all leaked

300
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
This is the thing that the Git predicted

301
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But your Diff Nino

302
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So it's growing in the Diff

303
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Suppose your Git Diff

304
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
If you put this Unify color as 0

305
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Basically

306
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It will only leak this red and green

307
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Can we try

308
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Basically it has a

309
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There is a Diff thing

310
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Anyway, this is

311
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This is basically the adjustment

312
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Can you think about it

313
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I want to see the front

314
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
How many rows are there with the back

315
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The prediction is three rows

316
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So basically you adjust it

317
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
If we send it to OpenAI

318
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Can reduce the token amount

319
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So this is also a good thing to reduce the token amount

320
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So if your

321
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Your Diff Nino is very long

322
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Basically you can adjust it a little

323
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Then you can save some tokens

324
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I think you can set it as 0

325
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Because

326
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Basically OpenAI

327
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Look at the front and the back

328
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The whole answer is not very big

329
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So basically I set it as 0

330
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
OK

331
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Then there is Isqulist

332
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I think this is very useful

333
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What are you doing

334
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Suppose you change things such as

335
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Package.JSON

336
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Package is

337
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
MPN

338
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
There is no use in that

339
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Or in GO

340
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
For example, this GO GO

341
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
This thing is actually useless

342
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Then send it to OpenAI

343
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And then the token amount is occupied

344
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So basically I will choose this

345
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So similar to this

346
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
OK

347
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
For example, like this

348
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Diff Unify

349
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Then Isqulist

350
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I set it for example

351
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You have Taste of Fire

352
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That basically

353
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
There is no meaning

354
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We don't want to give OpenAI

355
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
We don't want to give AI to look

356
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But it is in this token amount

357
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
We can just drop it

358
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Basically this is the parameters

359
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So this is what we just talked about

360
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It can do

361
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The preview of the token amount

362
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You can also download the preview

363
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The first thing is that I don't

364
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Do this

365
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Do the token amount on the token

366
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Help you do the token amount

367
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Then you basically have Stained Fire

368
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Still in

369
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Then this is to write your wrong translation

370
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Basically don't use this function

371
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Don't translate the code into Chinese

372
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Because the token amount of Chinese is quite large

373
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So everyone please use it

374
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Then this is

375
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Just demoed

376
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If you are not satisfied with the first

377
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The code content of the first card

378
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You can keep downloading this command

379
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You can continue to modify the last card

380
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Then there is a user who told me before

381
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
This card content is a little bit different from the format

382
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Change it

383
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No problem

384
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You can define this template

385
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
There are several parameters

386
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Summary of Preface

387
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Summary of Title

388
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Summary of Message

389
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You can use it

390
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So you can download a

391
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Template Stream

392
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
To change these things

393
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Or Template Fire

394
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You can set it up

395
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay, it's not here to talk about the key

396
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Install and Uninstall

397
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Then you can

398
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Get Add

399
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
After these fires

400
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Next key card

401
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It will jump out of a window

402
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That is the window in the card

403
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Then put the AI

404
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The layer of the layer of AI

405
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Go down

406
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So you see it's going to help you do the code

407
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So it's very simple

408
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Then let's talk about a calling

409
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That calling is not very easy

410
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's the same as the key card

411
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Just say it doesn't help you do the code

412
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It helps you do the call review

413
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That's what it means

414
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay, let's do the same

415
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Let's take a look at an example

416
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Suppose we let's take a look at this code

417
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Okay

418
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Let's go to the PHP file

419
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Okay

420
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Click on the front

421
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
HP

422
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Okay

423
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Then the same

424
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Let's put the key card on it

425
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Okay, let's take a look at this

426
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
How to use it

427
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Code to the PHP

428
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay

429
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
We are

430
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Anyway, just use

431
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Review

432
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Let's do the next review

433
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Okay

434
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
After the next review

435
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It will go to the content in the Stage Fire

436
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Then it will start to do the review code change

437
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Then this is really

438
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It needs to be spent a period of time

439
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Then you can spray these

440
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
These reviews

441
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
In fact, this thing is actually very useful

442
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The reviewer told you that it may have some

443
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Some ingestion

444
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So you have to go to

445
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
To verify your input and what

446
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Enter the show as a card

447
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So I think these

448
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The tools are very useful

449
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's five points for you

450
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's five points for you

451
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So basically I hope this thing can be used

452
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Our

453
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The software is open

454
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Every time the user posts a PR

455
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
For example, your team

456
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The team is posting a PR

457
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's automatic

458
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
From your

459
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
From your card

460
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
All the content in it

461
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Go to the code review

462
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Give a summarize

463
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That this summarize

464
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Is very useful to you

465
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
For the developer

466
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's very useful to the developer

467
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Then for the reviewer

468
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
He can look at this first

469
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
He can look at this review

470
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Summon

471
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You know that you

472
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What are you doing with this whole code

473
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And maybe some

474
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What are the problems in the first

475
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And what suggestions do you give

476
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Basically

477
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Usually need to say

478
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
He actually has some

479
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Some ingestion

480
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That's not you

481
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But do you have to wait for you to fix it

482
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'll go and see

483
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
No problem

484
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So basically I think

485
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The suggestions given by AI

486
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Are very, very useful

487
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Not just in

488
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Code

489
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The code is very much

490
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Because he almost

491
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I've finished looking at the game

492
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That's the data of 2021

493
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Then I think that

494
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The whole model base

495
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Has been very, very strong

496
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So basically

497
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
He can look at the language

498
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Okay

499
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That's what I'm going to introduce today

500
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I think this is very useful

501
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Then below is that

502
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Okay

503
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Then now it's China and Hong Kong

504
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Actually

505
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Most companies are strict about the transparency

506
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So this tool

507
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I just developed

508
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Process function

509
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Can be connected to the sake

510
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You can connect through the process

511
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Or go to

512
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Ask OpenAI

513
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Or if you have

514
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
If you have a base UI

515
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You can add a form

516
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Or pass it

517
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's okay

518
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Okay

519
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
If you expect it

520
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I think the next step

521
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Is to open the whole of the age

522
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
After coming in

523
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
He will support

524
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
OpenAI

525
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
He will support

526
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Age of OpenAI

527
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Because OpenAI

528
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The biggest share is

529
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Microsoft

530
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Microsoft is also

531
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
This thing

532
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Combined with their

533
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The whole age of the whole cloud service

534
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So basically

535
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
We are

536
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Most of the companies

537
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's impossible to go to the OpenAI

538
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
To do the same

539
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Because he didn't have the ability to say

540
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
He won't take your data

541
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Do any

542
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The full-time work

543
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But Microsoft

544
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
He is in this area

545
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Is having the ability to say

546
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
We will never go

547
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Where to go

548
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
To do that

549
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
This is the right thing

550
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This is to sign with Microsoft

551
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The contract after that

552
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So this is

553
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The big company is going to go to the right place

554
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
good

555
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I hope

556
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I hope that the introduction of this tool

557
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Is helpful to everyone

558
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
If you like it

559
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You can help me

560
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Go to the new one

561
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Click on the war

562
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
At present, in fact, I think

563
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
There are quite a lot of people using it

564
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So now it's probably

565
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
More than 300 people

566
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
If you like it

567
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Just help me introduce the goods

568
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Promote

569
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Thank you all
