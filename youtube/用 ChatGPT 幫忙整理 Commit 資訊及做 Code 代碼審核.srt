00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, everyone, I am Buyi.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This class will introduce a tool called

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Use the TrueGPT Automation Developer

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Create a coming message

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I will explain the three important things later.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The first is why the code is called "GPT"

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's introduce the TrueGPT

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
How to use it

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's talk about the latest one.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I use the new one.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
OK, everyone should not be unfamiliar with TrueGPT

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Currently, it is AI, AIGC, AI Generator, Content

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
At present, when it comes to red-grinding machine

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
All the software development workers in the world are thinking about

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
How to use TrueGPT to help us develop the entire software process

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Or improve our environment

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And I am most important here

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Use TrueGPT to write the KitKartMessage

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How to write the KitKartMessage

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You can refer to this article

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I will put it in the link below

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I directly use the source

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The source is called CodeGPT

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If you like it, you can share it with me

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The main point is to help the software development

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You can see CodeGPT creates the KitKartMessage effect

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You write the code first

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You have to write the KitKartMessage

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
For example, what does this function do

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Or how do I solve this bug

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You may want to say how to write the content

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let everyone know when they check

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
After we have CodeGPT

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We use AI to help you see the whole KitKartMessage

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We help to automatically create this content

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You see this is the bottom effect

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You see all the KartMessage here

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
All use this tool called CodeGPT

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Help me create

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Not me

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Basically, 8 or 9% is correct

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Basically, if you want to slightly tweak yourself

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You can do the effect you want

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Basically, if you have a long time to enter the code

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's also because I hope that the KartMessage you write

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Is helpful to the team

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This tool can help you to reduce a lot of time

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Ok, then

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't want to write CodeGPT

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
In fact, the KitKart platform has already

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Similar tools like this

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why do you want to re-develop it

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The first one is the cross-platform platform

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I need to use the source

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
To avoid the different platforms and different environments

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is easier for developers who do not receive the environment

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The second one is that my future plan is

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The next GitHub, GitHub, Bbac and other platforms

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
After sending PR, you can automatically help

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Help to organize the content of KartMessage

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And automatically leave a message

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Then this tool

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So my development tool is not just a single developer

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Can automatically create KartMessage

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
In the future, I hope that the whole

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Can be motivated to help to do the code

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Then the third reason is that in the future

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I hope it's not just an open AI API

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The current API of TrueGPT

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Currently in Azure's API

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Open AI has been supported

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Next, let's talk about how to use it

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Actually, it's very simple

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Every time, the number of users will have

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The corresponding self-sufficiency file of Linux, Mac OS Windows

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You just need to send it to BIN

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Then go to OpenAI's website

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Create an API key

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Every month seems to be free 18 dollars

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But I think this is already cheap

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
In fact, every day, you know

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No matter how much you have, it is TrueGPT

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
3.5 Turbo version

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's actually very cheap

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So basically, you look at KartMessage

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He saw the token number

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Actually not even a dollar

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's quite cheap, so everyone put the credit card on it

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Because it's very useful for your

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Write KartMessage

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And you don't have to waste time to organize

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The things you wrote

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
After everyone has finished

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You can use the blog to install

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We can take a look

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's take a look at this website

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Ok, it's very simple

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You can download from this list

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
To the corresponding self-sufficiency file

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You can download

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The answer for your answer

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
64 and Andy 64 or Linux version

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Or Windows version can be

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Or you can use Mac

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Very simple

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You can use Blue install

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Basically, it's blue tab

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Apple Boy's Latch tab

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Then install

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Then the next step is

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
How to use

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Set up your API key

113
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's very simple, you can use it after you create your API key

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You just need to export this variable

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll do the post-sale thing next

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's see how to use it at the bottom

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's take a look

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's take a look at the current

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Karmineo

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Ok, because it's here

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I changed one thing

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's take a look at

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
GITLIF

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Ok, look, I changed this

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
After we change it, let's see how it

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
How to do it

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let's set it to 3

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Ok, now we have a code GBT

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This Karmineo

130
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You can play hlp

131
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You can see that it has many Karmineo

132
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The first Karmineo

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It will help you to auto-jump the Karmineo

134
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Then you can set your own Karmineo

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Let me introduce this a little bit

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Then you can also use the GITHOOG method

137
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This is less used

138
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If you need it, you can use it

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It will help you to set a GITHOOG

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Under your point

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Under the point key

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
To change your Karmineo

143
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Then you can auto-jump the Karmineo

144
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
When you use Karmineo

145
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Then there is a most important function

146
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It can go to the remote control

147
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So I will introduce it later

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's take a look at it

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
We are now in a stage state

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
There is a CND.go

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's take a look at the content

152
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Ok, in fact,

153
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Change the variable of a console

154
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Change the variable of a console

155
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Change the variable of a console

156
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Ok, let's use the code "gbt"

157
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Karmineo

158
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Then it will automatically use the 3.5 GBT

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
After the turbo version

160
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Then it will tell you what is Karmineo

161
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It will tell you the "up the environment"

162
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
"Marable"

163
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Then it will tell you

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The content inside it is

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I changed the Github to input

166
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I changed the weight to the bottom

167
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
After changing it, it basically writes to you

168
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Karmineo

169
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So you can see

170
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's automatically changed to this way

171
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Ok, if you are not satisfied with this message

172
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You can use the other way

173
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You can download this

174
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Then this is actually

175
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The same as your Github Karmineo

176
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You will go to change the Karmineo

177
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Ok, we will do it next

178
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It must be the 3.5 GBT turbo version

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
After that, it will

180
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Change a new message

181
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Ok, until you change

182
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The message you want

183
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So you can keep changing

184
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Of course

185
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's all up to your

186
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The token amount

187
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So you see here, I tell you

188
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
How much is your Pond token

189
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Then how much is your Karmineo token

190
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Then the total token here is these two

191
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Then it's your last

192
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You may have to pay the price

193
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Now every 1000 tokens is 0.002 USD

194
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's very cheap

195
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So basically you don't care how much you use every day

196
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Almost not much

197
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So you can save

198
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Go to save every day to pay the drinks

199
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
In fact, you can save a day

200
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How much is your Karmineo

201
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So I think it's basically

202
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That other

203
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Let's take a look at the Internet

204
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Ok, then in fact

205
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We can go through a code

206
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Use Karmineo to

207
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Set some environment data

208
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
For example, I wrote down the OPAPL

209
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
After writing it down

210
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Basically, I don't have to go to the eSports anymore

211
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Because it will directly

212
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Under the screen

213
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
CodeGPT

214
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
CodeGPT.yaml

215
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Go to write in these settings

216
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Then it's automatic

217
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So basically you don't have to worry about it

218
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Then openAI

219
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
OpenAI has a function

220
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Base

221
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The line is here

222
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why is this function

223
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You see now all companies

224
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Almost all of this

225
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
OpenAI's king is all blocked

226
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
After that, everyone is crazy

227
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
For the policy

228
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
For the policy

229
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You can change this point

230
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Base UI

231
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I guess at the beginning

232
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
OpenAI should have

233
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Found this problem

234
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
When the recording is out

235
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He told me that he can

236
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Everyone can change the base UI

237
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So you can change it into what you want

238
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Everyone can use this free

239
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Many people think that

240
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
My key is stolen

241
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What are you doing

242
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If I don't believe it, I'll go to the store myself

243
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
This is a Chinese developer

244
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Developers

245
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Then he is a developer of Dino

246
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay, then you can put some

247
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Some data

248
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
API key and your organization

249
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Just assume that your account

250
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Have more organization

251
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Remember to set this

252
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Then you can use the model you want to use

253
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Now you can use the GPT 3.5

254
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Turbo or say

255
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You need a lot of tokens

256
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Because GP3.5's token is the token of 409

257
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Then you can change it to GPT4

258
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You can use 8K token

259
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Or 32K token

260
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But its cost is

261
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
One is 15 times

262
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
One is 30 times

263
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So everyone, be careful

264
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
If you need it

265
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But basically if you just want to do

266
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The card version

267
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
If you use GPT3.5

268
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The terminal is very, very useful

269
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Then the language

270
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You basically use it now

271
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Because of the language

272
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You can change your card version

273
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Chinese

274
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Translate Chinese

275
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Significance Chinese

276
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And Japanese

277
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The point is to use these three

278
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Then I wrote a

279
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Plastic function

280
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Or sake

281
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
To make links

282
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So you

283
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You have been doing these sake and plastic

284
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You can use this method to connect

285
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This open AI

286
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Then it's time out

287
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
This time out is to assume that your

288
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Your token needs to look a lot

289
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Sometimes open AI

290
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Will be noisy because open AI

291
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Too many people are using

292
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So sometimes it's very slow

293
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So you just adjust this type of

294
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Then there is miss token

295
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This token is that

296
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
When you reply

297
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
These words are too sour

298
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
In this

299
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The token of completion

300
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Then if you have a complete token

301
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If not enough

302
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You can increase it from here

303
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That default is 300

304
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But adjust this

305
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The most important thing is

306
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Because you are doing code review

307
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Need this

308
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
good

309
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
good

310
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Then there is also temperature

311
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Temperature

312
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
This is the basic

313
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Open AI parameters

314
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
0.7

315
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
0.0 to 0 to 2

316
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Then the higher you are

317
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The higher the answer is

318
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The higher the answer

319
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So don't be too high

320
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Don't be too low

321
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So everyone 0.7

322
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This is the number of people on the Internet

323
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There is another called

324
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Diff Unify

325
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This thing

326
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I will add this

327
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You can look at it

328
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Sometimes I put this

329
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Ok like this

330
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You will see that

331
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
My Diff Nino

332
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
He has put the front and the back

333
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
All out

334
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This is the thing that the Git is expected to do

335
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But your Diff Nino

336
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So it's growing in the Diff

337
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's your Git Diff

338
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
If you set this Unify to 0

339
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Basically

340
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
He will only make this

341
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Red and green

342
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
We can try it

343
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Ok, there is a

344
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
There is a Diff thing

345
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Anyway, this is

346
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This is basically the adjustment

347
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Can you think about it?

348
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I want to see the front row

349
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And the back row

350
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The expected color is 3 rows

351
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So basically you adjust

352
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We give to the token

353
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We give to Open AI

354
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You can reduce the token amount

355
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So this is also the benefit of reducing the token amount

356
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So if your Diff Nino is very long

357
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Basically you can adjust it a little

358
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Will reduce some tokens

359
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Then basically I think you can set it to 0

360
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Because

361
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Basically Open AI is looking at the front

362
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The front and the back

363
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The whole answer is not very big

364
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So basically I set it to you

365
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Ok, then there is the Isqulist

366
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I think this is very, very useful

367
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What does this thing do?

368
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Suppose you change things

369
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
For example, that kind of package

370
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The package is

371
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
NPN

372
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
NPN that confine

373
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The function of the party

374
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That actually has no use

375
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Or the structure inside

376
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
For example, this structure

377
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
This thing actually has no use

378
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Then send it to

379
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Open AI and set the token amount

380
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So basically I will choose this

381
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So if it's similar, it's like this

382
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Ok, let's think about it

383
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
For example, like this

384
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I set it to you

385
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Diff Unified

386
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Then this Isqulist

387
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I set it to you

388
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Taste of Fire

389
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That basically doesn't mean anything

390
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We don't want to give Open AI

391
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
We don't want to give AI to look

392
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But it's in this package

393
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
We can just tear it off

394
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Basically this is the parameters

395
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So this is what we just talked about

396
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It can do

397
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The preview of the package

398
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You can also download the preview

399
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The preview means that I don't

400
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Do this

401
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Make a package on the package

402
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Help you make a package

403
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Then you basically

404
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You are still in the stagefire

405
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Then this is the translation you wrote wrong

406
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Then basically don't use this function

407
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Don't translate the code into Chinese

408
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Because the token amount of Chinese is quite large

409
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So please use it carefully

410
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Then this is the demo

411
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Suppose you are not satisfied with the message of the previous package

412
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You can always download this command

413
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You can always modify the last package

414
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Then there was a user before telling me

415
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
This package's format can be changed a little

416
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
No problem, you can define this template

417
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Then there are several parameters

418
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Summary of Preface

419
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Summary of Title

420
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Summary of Message

421
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You can use it

422
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So you can download a template

423
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
To change these things

424
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Or a template fire

425
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You can set it up

426
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Okay, the key is not here

427
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's very simple

428
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Install and uninstall

429
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Then you can

430
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
GetAdder

431
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
After these fires

432
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Then download a key to the package

433
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It will jump out of a window

434
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That is the window in the package

435
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Then download the package of AI

436
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So you see it's after this upgrade

437
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It will make you a copy

438
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So it's very simple

439
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Then let's talk about a calling view

440
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That calling view is very simple

441
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's the same as the key's calling view

442
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Just say it doesn't help you make a copy

443
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It helps you make a calling view

444
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That's what it means

445
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Okay, let's take a look at an example

446
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Suppose we look at this code

447
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Okay, let's test that PHP file

448
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Okay, .mphp

449
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Okay, let's put the file on

450
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Okay, let's take a look at this

451
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
How to use this

452
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
CodeGPD

453
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay, we are

454
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Anyway, just use

455
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Review

456
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Let's do the next review

457
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Okay, after the next review

458
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It will look at the content in this stagefiring

459
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Then it will start to do the review code change

460
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Then this is really

461
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It needs to take a while

462
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Then you can spray these messages in the next time

463
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
In fact, this thing is actually very useful

464
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
In the beginning, I told you that it may have some

465
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Some ingestion

466
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So you have to go to verify your input

467
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What is it? Enter the user's code

468
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So I think these tools are very useful

469
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's five points for you

470
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's five points for you

471
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So basically I hope this thing can continue

472
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Our

473
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
RuntyCoverFloor

474
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Every time the user sends PR

475
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
For example, your team is sending PR

476
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I automatically

477
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
From your

478
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
From your code

479
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
All the content

480
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Go to the code review to summarize

481
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That summarizes

482
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
For you

483
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Very useful

484
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
For the developer

485
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's very useful to send PR

486
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
For the reviewer, he can look at this first

487
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
He can look at this review

488
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You know that you

489
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What are you doing with your whole code

490
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And what problems are happening

491
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What suggestions do you have

492
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Basically, it usually needs to say

493
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Since there are some

494
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Some ingestion

495
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That's not you

496
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But do you have to wait for you to fix it

497
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'll go and see

498
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
No problem

499
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So basically I think the suggestions

500
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The suggestions given by AI are very, very useful

501
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Not just in

502
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Code

503
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The PHP is very much seen in the language

504
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Because he almost finished

505
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The GitHub code

506
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's the data of 2021

507
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Then I think that

508
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The whole model base

509
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Has been very, very strong

510
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So basically

511
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
He can see the language

512
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Okay, that's what I'm going to introduce today

513
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That's very useful

514
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's below

515
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That's good

516
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's now China and Hong Kong

517
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
In fact, most companies

518
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Are strict with the PHP

519
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So this tool

520
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I just developed

521
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Process function

522
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You can connect with the Sacky method

523
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You can use the process method

524
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Or visit OpenAI

525
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Or say

526
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
If you have a base UI

527
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If you have a Java or a proxy

528
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's okay

529
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Okay, then if you want

530
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I think the next step

531
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Is Azure OpenAI

532
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
After coming in

533
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
He will support Azure OpenAI

534
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Because OpenAI

535
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The biggest share is software

536
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That software is also

537
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
This thing is for the whole

538
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
When they are

539
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The whole cloud service in Azure

540
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So basically

541
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
We are

542
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Most of the companies

543
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's impossible to go to OpenAI

544
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
To do the same

545
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Because he didn't have the ability to say

546
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
He won't take your data

547
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Do any

548
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The full-time work

549
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But the software

550
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
He is in this area

551
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Is having the ability to say

552
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
We will never take your code

553
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
To do that

554
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This is to sign with the software

555
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The contract later

556
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So this is the

557
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The big company is going to the right place

558
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
good

559
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Then I hope

560
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I hope to introduce this tool today

561
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Is to help everyone

562
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
If you like it

563
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You can help me to click

564
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Click on the heart

565
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Click on the war

566
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
At present, I actually think it's a lot of people using it

567
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So now it's probably more than 300 people

568
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
If you like it

569
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Just help me introduce the goods

570
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Promote it
