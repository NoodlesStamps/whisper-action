1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello everyone, I am V

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This class introduces a tool to everyone

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Called using Chord GPT to automatically help developers

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Produce commit manager

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Ok, I will explain to you later

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Three main points, the first one is why I write

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Code GPT

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The second one we introduce Chord GPT

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
How to use

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Then we will talk about the performance of my use

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Ok, everyone should not be unfamiliar with Chord GPT

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That is currently AI, AI GC, AI Generator, Content

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
At present, when the red bomb is in the world

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The software development engineers all think

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
How to use Chord GPT to help us develop

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The entire software process or improve our

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Use or environment

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And I am here mainly to use Chord GPT

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
To help you write Git commit manager

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How to write Git commit manager

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You can refer to this article

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Then I may put it in the following link

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Ok, I'm here, I'm using Go

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Written a CL tool called Code GPT

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If you like, you can share it with me

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In fact, the main point is to help the software development engineer

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
To organize the development content

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You can see Code GPT

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Produce commit manager effect

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That is, when you write all the codes today

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You have to write to organize the commit manager

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
After you say what this function does

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Or how do I solve this bug

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Then today you may think about how to go

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Write this content that makes everyone

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I was very touched when I came to check

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Then we use Chord GPT

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We use AI to help you see the whole

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
After the Git diff content

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's help to automatically generate this message

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You see this is the bottom effect

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You can see all my commands here

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
All use this tool called Chord GPT

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Help me generate it

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Not written by me

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
In fact, basically, 80% to 90% are correct

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Basically, you just have to slightly adjust yourself

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You can do the effect you want

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So basically if you are

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I've been sending other people's codes for a long time

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I also hope that the commitment message you wrote

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Is helpful to the team

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This tool can help you improve

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Reduce a lot of time

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Ok, why do we write Chord GPT?

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
In fact, the GitHub platform has already

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
There are many similar tools

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why do you have to redevelop again

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The first is cross-platform

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I need to use the fast-release and self-sufficient block

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Avoid different platforms and install different environments

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This is for developers who are unfamiliar with the environment

63
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Can be easier to install

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The second is that my future plan is

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The following GitHub, Github, Bitbucker, etc.

66
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
After sending the PR

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You can automatically help through Chord GPT

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Help you sort out the content of the code

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And automatically leave a message

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So this tool

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So my developer tool is not just

72
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let developers generate their own commitments

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
In the future, I hope to be able to

74
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Can be integrated

75
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Help to carry out the code review

76
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The third reason is that in the future

77
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I hope it's not just the open AI API

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Chord GPT API

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Currently in the A9 API

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
OpenAI has been supported

81
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Ok, let's talk about the usage now

82
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Actually very simple

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Every time the output will be

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Linux Mac OS Windows download

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Relative execution

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You just download it and put it in Bin

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Then go to the OpenAI website and create an API key

88
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The first month seems to be free of $18

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But I think this is already cheap

90
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
In fact, every day you only

91
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No matter how much you commit

92
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Now is Chord GPT 3.5 Turbo version

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's actually very cheap

94
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So basically you commit a message a day

95
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Look at the amount of token he has seen

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Actually less than a dollar

97
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Pretty cheap

98
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So everyone put the new version on

99
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Because it's very useful for you to write a commitment

100
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And you don't have to waste time

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Go and sort out what you have written

102
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Ok, after everyone has done it

103
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
In fact, you can use Blue to install

104
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We can take a look

105
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's take a look at this page

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's easy for you to download from this release

107
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
To the corresponding execution

108
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You can download the Darwin ARM64 and AMD DOS

109
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Or the Linux version

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Or the Windows version

111
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Or you can say you are very simple

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
If you use Mac

113
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You can just use Blue Install

114
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Basically Blue Tab

115
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Apple Boy/Tab

116
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Then install

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Then the next step is how to use

118
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Setup your API key

119
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is very simple

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
After producing your API key

121
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You can use it yourself

122
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
After you go to the export variable

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Then you will do the post-release self-release

124
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's see how to use it below

125
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Let's take a look

126
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's take a look at the current content

127
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Because he is here

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I changed something

129
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Then we take a look

130
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
git diff

131
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
After you see me change this

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's take a look at it next

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
How to do it

134
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's reset it to the previous state

135
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Ok, next we have code gpt

136
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This command line

137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You can hit hlp

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You can see that he has a lot of commands to use

139
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The first one is the command

140
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He will help you to auto-generate the command mesh

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Then you can set your own commands

142
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let me introduce this a little bit

143
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Then you can also use the git hook method to do it

144
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This is less used

145
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
If you need it, you can also use it

146
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He will help you install a git hook

147
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Under your git

148
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
To improve your command hook

149
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That command hook is when you command every time

150
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He will automatically help you generate these messages

151
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Then he has the most important function

152
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
He can review your code

153
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So this will be introduced later

154
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Let's take a look

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Because we are now in a stage state

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
There is a cmd.go

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
When this file has been changed

158
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Let's take a look at the content

159
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Actually, it's just a

160
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Change a const to a

161
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Change it to a self-defined branch

162
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Then we just use the code gpt

163
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Kami

164
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
In this way, he will automatically use

165
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
After the gpt 3.5 turbo version

166
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Next he told you that

167
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What is the summary of the kami

168
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He told you that

169
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Updating environment variable

170
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Preface for consistency

171
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Then he told you that

172
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The content inside is

173
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I changed the github to input

174
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Change the zone to the bottom

175
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Then after completion

176
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Basically, it will help you write a kami message

177
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Automatically help you kami

178
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So you see

179
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You are automatically changed to this

180
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
good

181
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If you are to this

182
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If you are not satisfied with this message

183
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You can use another way

184
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You can go down

185
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This

186
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This is actually with your github

187
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The content is the same

188
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You will go to the last one

189
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Kami message

190
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
After we go down

191
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He must execute

192
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
gpt 3.5 turbo version

193
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
After completing the command

194
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He will go

195
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Change a new message

196
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Good

197
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Until you change to

198
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What you want

199
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The message you want

200
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So you can keep changing

201
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Of course

202
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is the money that is linked to your calculation token

203
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So you see

204
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I told you here

205
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Your

206
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
How much is the Pong token used

207
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Then your

208
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
How much is the Confession token used

209
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Then the total token here is these two added

210
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That is the last

211
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You may have to pay the most

212
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Now every 1000 tokens is 0.002 US dollars

213
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That is very cheap

214
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So basically you every day

215
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No matter how much you use

216
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Almost less than a dollar

217
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So you can save

218
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Go to the bank every day

219
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Money for drinks

220
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
In fact, you can save your money every day

221
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How much time is the time to Kami message

222
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So I think it's basically

223
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's pretty convenient

224
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What about the other parameters

225
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Let's take a look at the content of the website

226
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
How to use

227
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
it is good

228
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Then we can actually use a code

229
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Gpt to use

230
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Confession this paper

231
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
To save some environment elements

232
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
For example

233
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay, I put the open API key

234
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
After writing in

235
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Basically, I don't have to go to the e-sport anymore

236
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Because it will directly occupy the

237
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The e-converter under the home screen

238
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The code of the code gpt

239
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Code gpt.yaml

240
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Go write these parameters in

241
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Then it automatically writes

242
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So basically you don't have to worry too much

243
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Then again

244
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
OpenAi

245
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It has a parameter

246
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Base bottom line ul

247
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Why is this parameter here

248
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The reason is this

249
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You see all companies now

250
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Almost all of this

251
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
OpenAi's website is blocked

252
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Then after blocking

253
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Everyone is crazy

254
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Pretend for world policy

255
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
For world policy

256
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You can go to this

257
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Change the base url

258
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Then I guess

259
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
OpenAi should have found this problem

260
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
When it was released

261
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He told me

262
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He can click

263
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Then his base url can be changed

264
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So you can change it to what you want

265
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Then everyone can use this free

266
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Then many people think

267
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Then my key was stolen

268
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What are you doing

269
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If you don't believe it, just add it yourself

270
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Then this is a Chinese developer

271
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Assume

272
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Then he is a Dino developer

273
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay, then you can put some

274
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Some data to the developer

275
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
API key

276
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And your organization

277
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Assume your account

278
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
There are more than one organization

279
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Remember to set this

280
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay, then you may want to use the model

281
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Which one

282
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Then you can use gbt3.5

283
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Turbo or

284
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You need more tokens

285
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Because gbt3.5

286
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
His token value is

287
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
409 tokens

288
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Then you change to gbt4

289
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Maybe you can use 8k tokens

290
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Or 32k tokens

291
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But its cost is

292
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
One is 15 times

293
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
One is 30 times

294
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So please be careful if you need to use it

295
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If you just want to do

296
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Commendations and review codes

297
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Gbt3.5's Terminal is very useful

298
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Then in terms of language

299
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You basically use English

300
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You can change your command

301
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
into

302
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Chinese

303
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Finding Chinese and Chinese and Japanese are all possible

304
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The goal is to install these three

305
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Then I wrote more here

306
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
A plus function

307
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Or the sake method to do some

308
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So you have to do these

309
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If you do these sake and pos, you can

310
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You can connect this openAI UI through this method

311
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Then it's time out

312
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
This time out is your commitment

313
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
If you need to see a lot of your tokens

314
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Sometimes openAI will be noisy

315
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Because openAI is too much

316
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So sometimes it will be very slow

317
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So you can just turn this time out high

318
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Then it's next

319
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Missed token

320
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This token means

321
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
When you reply

322
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
These words are also included in this

323
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Composition token

324
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Then suppose you have your compression token

325
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
If it's not enough, you can increase it from here

326
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Default is 300

327
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But the main reason for adjusting this is

328
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Because you need this when you are doing code review

329
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
it is good

330
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Then there is temperature

331
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
This is the basic parameter of openAI

332
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
0.7

333
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
0.0 between 0 to 2

334
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The higher you are, the more the answer is

335
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So don't be too high and don't be too low

336
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So the answer is 0.7

337
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This is the parameter of everyone on the Internet

338
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There is another one called

339
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
GIF Unify

340
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I want to introduce this

341
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You can take a look

342
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
For example, I put this in

343
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Ok, that's it

344
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You will see that

345
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I have this GIF content

346
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It has the front three and the back three

347
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
List out

348
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This is what Git predicts

349
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But your GIF content

350
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So it looks like this in GIF

351
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What about your GIF

352
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If you set this Unify to 0

353
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Basically it will only list

354
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What about this red and green

355
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We can try

356
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Basically it has a

357
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There is a GIF thing

358
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Anyway, this is

359
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This parameter is basically adjusting

360
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You can adjust it

361
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I want to see the front few rows

362
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
With the back few rows

363
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The preset is three rows

364
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So basically you adjust that

365
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We give it to the token

366
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
If we give it to openAI

367
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You can reduce the amount of token

368
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So this is also a benefit of reducing the amount of token

369
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So if you

370
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Your review content is very long

371
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Basically you can adjust it a little

372
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You can reduce some tokens

373
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Basically I think it can be set to 0

374
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
because

375
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Basically openAI is

376
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The front few and the back few

377
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
There is no big impact on the entire answer

378
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So basically I set it to 0

379
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Ok, then it's Coolist

380
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Ok, I think this is also very, very useful

381
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What is this thing used for

382
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Suppose you change something

383
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
For example, that package.json

384
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Package is

385
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
npm

386
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
npm,conf,json

387
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's actually useless

388
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Or in the Go

389
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
For example, this is the point of Go

390
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
This thing is actually useless

391
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Then send it in

392
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
OpenAI also occupies the amount of token

393
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So basically I will choose this

394
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So if it's similar, it's like this

395
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Ok, let me think about it

396
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
For example, like this

397
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I set it to 0

398
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
diff unify

399
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Then this is Coolist

400
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I set it, for example, you have test file

401
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Basically, it's useless

402
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We don't give it to openAI

403
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
We don't give it to openAI

404
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But it's in this commit

405
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
We can just filter it out

406
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Basically, these parameters

407
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So this is what we just talked about

408
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It can do

409
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Commit Preview

410
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You can also add Preview

411
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Preview means that I don't put

412
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
This time

413
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Commit on Commit

414
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Commit for you

415
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Then you basically have your stage file

416
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Still there

417
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Then this is to help you translate

418
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Basically don't use this function

419
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Don't translate it into Chinese

420
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Because the amount of token in Chinese is quite large

421
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So please use it carefully

422
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Then this is what I just demonstrated

423
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
If you are not satisfied with the previous commit

424
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
If you are not satisfied with the message

425
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
If you are not satisfied with the message

426
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You can always put this command

427
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You can always modify the last commit

428
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Then again

429
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Before there was a user who told me

430
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Hey, can you change the format of this commit?

431
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
No problem

432
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You can define this template

433
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
There are a total of several parameters

434
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Summary Preview

435
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Summary Title

436
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Summary Message

437
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You can use

438
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So you can add a

439
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Timbre Stream

440
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
To change this thing

441
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Or Timbre Fire

442
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You can set it up

443
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:40,380
Good, I won't talk about the Git

444
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,380
Call review is actually the same as Git commit

445
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,380
Just that he doesn't help you make a commit

446
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,380
He helps you do call review

447
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,380
This is what it means

448
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,380
Ok, then we are the same

449
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,380
Let's take a look at an example

450
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,380
Let's say we look at this call

451
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,380
Ok, let's add a PHP file

452
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,380
Ok, man.p hp

453
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,380
Ok, then we write it down

454
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,380
Ok, next we take a look at this

455
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,380
How to use this

456
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,380
Call gpt

457
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,380
Ok, we are

458
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,380
Anyway, only review

459
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,380
We will review next

460
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,380
After reviewing next

461
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,380
He went to see the content in this stage file

462
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,380
Then he started to do the review call change

463
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,380
This is really

464
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,380
He needs to spend some time

465
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,380
Then you can spray these messages

466
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,380
Actually, this thing is actually very useful

467
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,380
He will tell you that he may have some

468
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,380
Some ingressions

469
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,380
So you have to go to verify your input

470
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,380
What is it with

471
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,380
Enter the user's account

472
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,380
So I think these tools are very useful

473
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,380
He listed five points for you

474
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,380
He listed five points for you

475
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,380
So basically I hope this thing

476
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,380
Can continue our software development flow

477
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,380
Every time the user sends a PR

478
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,380
For example, when your team colleague sends a PR

479
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,380
I automatically

480
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,380
From your

481
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,380
From your whole content of this commit

482
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,380
To do call review

483
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,380
Give a summarize

484
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,380
That's a summary for you

485
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,380
It's very useful for the developer himself to send a PR

486
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,380
It's very useful for the reader

487
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,380
He can see this first

488
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,380
He can see this

489
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,380
The reader will know that

490
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,380
Hey, this is your whole code

491
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,380
What are you doing

492
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,380
And what may be produced

493
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,380
What problems are produced

494
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,380
And what suggestions do you give

495
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,380
Basically, I usually hope to say

496
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,380
Hey, he actually has some

497
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,380
Some ingressions

498
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,380
Then you didn't fix it

499
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,380
But wait for you to fix it

500
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,380
I'll go and see again

501
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,380
No problem

502
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,380
So basically I think the AI gives out

503
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,380
The suggestions are very, very useful

504
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,380
Not only in

505
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,380
Code language

506
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,380
In PHP, in any language

507
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,380
He sees a lot of it

508
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,380
Because he almost finished reading the Github code

509
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,380
That's 2021 data

510
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,380
Then I think that

511
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,380
The whole model base is already very, very powerful

512
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,380
So basically he can see that language

513
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,380
OK, this is the tool I'm going to introduce today

514
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,380
Then I think this is very useful

515
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,380
Then below is

516
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,380
OK, now is China and Hong Kong

517
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,380
Most companies have strict control over the whole

518
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,380
So this tool

519
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,380
Anyway, I developed it before

520
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,380
The process function can be linked to the socket

521
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,380
You can visit OpenAI through the process method

522
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,380
Or if you have a base UI

523
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,380
If you have your own Jaffa or Pross

524
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,380
It's also possible

525
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,380
OK, if you predict

526
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,380
I think the next step is the A9 OpenAI

527
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,380
When it comes in

528
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,380
It will support A9 OpenAI

529
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,380
Because the biggest shareholder of OpenAI is Microsoft

530
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,380
Microsoft also integrated this thing

531
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,380
Into their A9 Cloud service

532
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,380
So basically, in the future

533
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,380
Most companies will not be able to go with OpenAI

534
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,380
To do the connection

535
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,380
Because he has no ability to say

536
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,380
He won't take your data to do

537
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,380
Any training action

538
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,380
But Microsoft is on this side

539
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,380
Is able to say

540
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,380
We will never take your code

541
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,380
To do that training

542
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,380
This is to sign a follow-up contract with Microsoft

543
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,380
So this is the path that the big company is going to take

544
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,380
OK

545
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,380
I hope this tool will be helpful to you today

546
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,380
If you like

547
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,380
You can help me to like it

548
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,380
At present

549
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,380
I think there are quite a few people using it

550
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,380
So now there are about 300 people

551
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,380
If you like

552
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,380
Just help me introduce or promote

553
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,380
Thank you all

554
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:10,880
everyone
