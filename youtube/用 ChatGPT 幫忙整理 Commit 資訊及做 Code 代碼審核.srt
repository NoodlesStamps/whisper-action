00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, everyone, I am Bui

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This class can introduce a tool called

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Use the TrueGPT Automation Developmental

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Create a coming message

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I will explain to you later

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The first is why is the code GBT

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's introduce the TrueGPT

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
How to use

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's talk about the latest one

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I use the new one

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
OK, everyone should not be unfamiliar with TrueGPT

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Currently, it is AI, AIGC, AI Generator, Content

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
At present, when the red bomb is used

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
All the software development workers in the world are thinking about

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
How to use TrueGPT to help us develop the entire software

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Or improve our

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Use or environment

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And I am here mainly to use TrueGPT to help you write

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Kit Carman Manager

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How to write the Kit Carman Manager

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You can refer to this article

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Then I will put it in the link below

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
OK, I am here

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I directly use the source written in the CEL

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The code GBT

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If you like it, you can share it with me

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The main point is to help the software

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The software is to organize the development content

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You can see the code GBT

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The effect of creating Carman Manager

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That is, you write the code you wrote today

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You have to write to organize Carman Manager

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
For example, what does this function do

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Or how to solve this bug

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Then you may want to say how to

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Write the content

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let everyone check it out later

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Very good

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Then we have no code GBT

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I didn't use AI to help you to see the whole

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Kit different content

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
After that, we help to automatically create these

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You see this is the effect below

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You see all of my cards here

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
All use this tool called code GBT

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Help me produce it, but not me

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's basically what 8 or 9 are all right

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's basically what you want to do

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Just go to do what you want

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So basically if you are

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It takes a long time to write the code

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Then it's also

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I hope you write it yourself

54
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Carman Manager is helpful to the team

55
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This tool can help you to

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It takes a lot of time to improve

57
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
good

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't want to write code GBT

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
In fact, the platform of Github has already

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
There are more similar tools like this

61
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why do you want to re-develop it

62
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The first one is the cross-platform platform

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I need to use the source of the cross-platform platform to avoid the different platforms and different environments

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The second one is the future planning

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The next Github, Github, Bbac and other Github platforms

66
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
After sending PR, you can use the chat

67
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Gbt to help you to organize the content of Carman

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And automatically leave a message

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So this tool

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So my development tool is not just

71
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let the developer be able to produce Carman Manager

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I hope in the future

73
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Can help the whole team to do the code review

74
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The third reason is that in the future

75
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I hope it's not just the open AI API

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The Gbt API

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Currently in the A9 API

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Open AI has been supported

79
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay, let's talk about how to use it

80
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Actually, it's very simple

81
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There will be a Linux Mac OS Windows every time

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Download the corresponding execution file

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You just need to download it and send it to BIN

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Then go to the open AI website and create an API key

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The first month seems to be free 18 USD

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But I think this is already cheap

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
In fact, every day you just

88
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No matter how much you have, it is now a true Gbt 3.5 Turbo version

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's actually very cheap

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So basically you

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The message of Carman

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He saw the token number, actually not a dollar

93
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Quite cheap, so everyone put it on the credit card

94
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Because for you

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's very useful for your writing Carman Manager

96
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And you don't have to waste time to organize your own

97
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Write things

98
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay, then everyone can actually use

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Uh, Blue to install

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We can take a look

101
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's take a look at this website

102
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Okay, it's easy

103
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You can download from this list

104
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
To the corresponding execution file

105
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You can download the

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Use the blue install

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's basically blue tab

108
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Apple Boy's tab

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Then install

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Then the next step is

111
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The next step is how to use

112
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Set up your API key

113
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's very simple

114
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You can continue to use it after you create your API key

115
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You just need to export this variable

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
After that, you will go to do the post-production thing

117
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay, let's see how to use it in the bottom

118
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay, let's take a look

119
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Let's take a look at the current

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Carmineo

121
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay, because it's here

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I changed one thing up here

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Then let's take a look at the GIT leaf

124
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay, look at me

125
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
After I changed this

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's take a look at what it's going to do

127
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's set it to

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The third state

129
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay, now we have code gbt

130
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This Carmineo

131
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You can play hlp

132
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You can see that it has a lot of

133
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Carme can use

134
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The first Carmi

135
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He'll help you to auto generate a Carmi Mesh

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Then you can set your own Carmineo

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let me introduce this a little bit

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Then you can also use the GIT hook method

139
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Then this is less useful

140
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
If you need it, you can also use it

141
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He will help you to set up a GIT hook

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
In your store

143
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The store's GIT

144
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Go to change your Carmi hook

145
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Carmi hook is that you will automatically

146
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Send the message to Carmi

147
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Then there is one more important function

148
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It can go to the Reunit

149
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So this is what David will introduce

150
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Let's take a look at it

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Because we are now in a stage state

152
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
There is a CND

153
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The structure is changed

154
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We will open the content

155
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay, in fact, it is to change

156
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Change a constant

157
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Change it to a

158
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The address of your own address

159
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay, then we only use the code gbt

160
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Carmi

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So he will automatically

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Use the 3.5gbt turbo version

163
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
After that

164
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Next, he will tell you

165
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What is Carmi's summary

166
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He will tell you

167
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Up the environment

168
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Marible Preface for Consistency

169
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Then he will tell you

170
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The content in it is

171
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I changed the GitHub

172
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Change the input

173
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Change the weight to the bottom

174
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The small write is heavy

175
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Then after finishing it

176
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Basically write it to you

177
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Carmi message

178
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You automatically Carmi

179
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So you can see

180
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You are automatically changed here

181
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
like this

182
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
good

183
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
good

184
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If you are not satisfied with this message

185
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You can use the same method

186
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You can go down

187
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This

188
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's it

189
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's the same as your GIT Carmi

190
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You will change the Carmi message

191
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Good

192
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We will do it next

193
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He must be the new

194
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
GPD 3.5 Turbo version

195
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
After that

196
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He will go to change a new message

197
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
good

198
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Until you change

199
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What you want

200
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The message you want

201
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So you can keep changing

202
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Of course

203
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This is

204
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Sign up to the token you calculated

205
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So you see

206
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Here I tell you

207
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
How much is your Pond token

208
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Then how much is your comp

209
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And then here

210
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Total token is these two

211
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's your last

212
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You may have to pay the maximum

213
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Then the next one is

214
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Each 1000 tokens is 0.002

215
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's very cheap

216
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So basically you

217
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No matter how much you use

218
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Almost not much

219
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
More than a dollar

220
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So you can save

221
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The money you save every day

222
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
To order a cup of drinks

223
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
In fact, you can save a day

224
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
How much you save

225
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Carmi message

226
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So I think it's basically

227
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Pretty convenient

228
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Then the other

229
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Let's take a look at the website

230
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
How to use

231
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
good

232
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
In fact, we can go through a

233
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Code GPD

234
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Go to use the comp

235
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This is the point of the chain

236
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
To set up some environment

237
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
For example

238
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay, I wrote down the opa

239
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
After writing it in

240
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Basically, I don't have to go to the eSport anymore

241
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Because it will directly

242
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The store under the roof

243
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Code GPD store

244
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Code GPD store

245
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Go to write in these settings

246
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Then it's automatic

247
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So basically you don't have to go to the sign up

248
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Then what about

249
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
OpenAI

250
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
OpenAI has a window

251
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Base

252
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This is the reason why this window

253
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The reason is that

254
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You see all the companies now

255
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Almost all the companies in the network

256
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
OpenAI's network is blocked

257
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
After that

258
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Everyone is crazy

259
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The fake

260
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Forward proxy

261
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Then you can change the forward proxy

262
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You can change this point

263
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The best UI

264
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Then I guess at the beginning

265
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
OpenAI should have

266
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Found this problem

267
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Just when the file is out

268
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He told me that he can

269
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Everyone's best UI can be changed

270
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So you can change it

271
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What you want

272
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Then everyone can use this free

273
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Many people say that

274
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What if my key is stolen

275
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If I don't believe it, I'll just go and fake it myself

276
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Then this is a Chinese developer

277
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The price

278
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Then he is a Dino developer

279
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Ok

280
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Then you can put some

281
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Some data

282
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Write down

283
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
API key

284
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And your organization

285
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Just assume that your account

286
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
There are more organizations

287
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Remember to set this

288
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Ok

289
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Then you can use the model you want to use

290
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Then you can use GPD 3.5 now

291
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Turbo

292
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Or you need a larger token

293
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Because GPD 3.5

294
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
His token is the token of 409

295
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Then you can go to GPD 4

296
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Maybe you can use 8K token

297
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Or 32K token

298
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But his cost is

299
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
One is 15 times

300
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
One is 30 times

301
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So everyone, be careful to use it

302
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
If you need it

303
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But basically

304
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If you just want to do

305
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The card version

306
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
If you use GPD 3.5

307
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The terminal is very, very useful

308
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Then in terms of language

309
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You basically use it now

310
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
English

311
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You can change your card version

312
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Chinese

313
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Chinese

314
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Chinese

315
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Chinese

316
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,560
You can put it here

317
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,620
And then I have one more

318
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,600
Plask function or Sakir!

319
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,800
It's a link, so you're doing these Sakir and Plask

320
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,580
You can vote for this way to link this OpenAI UI

321
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,000
and then it's timeout

322
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,440
This timeout is to pretend that your

323
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,420
Your token needs to look very much

324
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,280
Sometimes OpenAI will be noisy because there is too much of OpenAI

325
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,020
So sometimes it will be very slow

326
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,500
So you just turn this type of high

327
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,240
Then there is Miss Token

328
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,320
This token is that

329
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,960
When you reply

330
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,320
These words are too sour

331
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,640
Is it in this compression token?

332
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,560
If you don't use this token, you can increase it from here

333
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,920
The default is 300

334
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,600
But the main reason for adjusting this is

335
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,480
Because you need this when you are doing code reviews

336
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,160
good

337
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,080
Then there is Temperature

338
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,120
This is the basic OpenAI parameters

339
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,300
0.7

340
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,200
0.0 to 0.2

341
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,460
Then the higher the answer, the higher the answer

342
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,980
So don't be too high or too low

343
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,380
So 0.7 should be the parameters of this network

344
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,740
There is another called

345
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,740
Diff Unify

346
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,460
This thing

347
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,860
I'll cut this

348
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,260
You can look at it

349
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,920
Sometimes I put this

350
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,020
Ok, this is good

351
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,620
You will see that my Diff Nino has

352
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,620
The front and the back are all leaked

353
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,940
This is the thing that Git predicted

354
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,420
But your Diff Nino

355
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,380
So it's like this in the Diff

356
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,360
If your Git Diff

357
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,360
If you set this Unify to 0

358
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
Basically

359
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,640
It will only leak this red and green

360
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,920
Can we try it

361
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,600
Ok, basically it has a

362
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,160
There is a Diff thing

363
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
Anyway, this is

364
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,560
This is basically the adjustment

365
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,800
Can you think about it?

366
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,440
He adjusts it

367
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,840
Do I want to see the front row

368
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,040
And the back row

369
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,400
The prediction is 3 rows

370
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,960
So basically you adjust it

371
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,420
We send it to token

372
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,740
We send it to OpenAI

373
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,540
You can reduce the token amount

374
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,540
So this is also the benefit of reducing the token amount

375
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,580
So if your

376
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,740
Your Diff Nino is very long

377
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,940
Basically you can adjust it a little bit

378
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,820
It will save some tokens

379
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,740
Then basically I think you can set it to 0

380
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,580
Because

381
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,300
Basically

382
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,500
OpenAI is looking at the front and the back

383
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,860
The whole answer is not very big

384
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,300
So basically I set it to 0

385
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,900
Ok

386
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,300
Then there is Isqulis

387
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,580
Ok, I think this is very useful

388
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,300
Then what does this thing do

389
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,300
Suppose you change things

390
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,020
For example, that kind of package

391
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,900
Point decision

392
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,220
Or package

393
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,020
That is

394
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,860
NPN

395
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,660
NPN

396
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,660
Confirmation of the decision

397
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,740
That actually has no use

398
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,180
Or the structure inside

399
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,020
For example, this structure

400
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,140
The point of the structure

401
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,780
This thing is actually no use

402
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,820
Then send it to

403
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,980
OpenAI and set the token amount

404
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,900
So basically I will choose this

405
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,260
So if it's similar, it's like this

406
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,740
Ok

407
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,220
For example, like this

408
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,900
I set it to 0

409
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,860
Defunify

410
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,140
Then Isqulis

411
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,620
I set it

412
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,940
For example, you have Taste of Fire

413
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,060
That basically doesn't mean anything

414
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,500
We don't want to give OpenAI

415
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,140
We don't want to give AI to look

416
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,660
But it's in this card

417
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,500
In the card

418
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,060
We just drop it

419
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,020
Basically this is the parameters

420
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,620
So this is what we just talked about

421
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,180
It's that it can do

422
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,620
The preview of the card

423
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,580
You can also download the preview

424
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,460
The first thing is that I don't

425
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,380
Do this

426
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,100
Do the card on the card

427
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,140
Help you do the card

428
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,860
Then you basically have Stained Fire

429
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,820
Still here

430
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,980
Then this is the translation of the script

431
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,940
Then basically don't use this function

432
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,140
Don't translate it into Chinese

433
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,580
Because the token amount of Chinese is quite large

434
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,340
So everyone please use it carefully

435
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,980
Then this is

436
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,900
Just demoed

437
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,260
If you are not satisfied with the first card content

438
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,660
Of the message

439
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,420
If you are not satisfied

440
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,260
You can keep downloading this command

441
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,740
You can continue to modify the last card

442
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,500
Then there was a user before

443
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Tell me

444
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,820
This card content is a little bit different

445
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,900
No problem

446
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,460
You can define this template

447
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,980
Then there are a few parameters

448
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,180
Summary of Preface

449
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,220
Summary of Title

450
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,260
Summary of Message

451
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:12,900
You can use it

452
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,980
So you can download a

453
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,900
Template Stream

454
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,300
To change these things

455
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,460
Or Template Fire

456
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,300
You can set it up

457
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,700
OK, the script is not here

458
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,700
It's very simple

459
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,740
Install

460
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,660
And Uninstall

461
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,420
Then you say

462
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,380
GetAdder

463
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,300
These fire

464
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,380
In the next Git card

465
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,980
It will jump out of a window

466
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,060
Is the window in the card

467
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,180
Then download the AI-shaped card

468
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,940
Water to you

469
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,540
So you see it's going to generate

470
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,660
It's going to help you do the card

471
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,340
So it's very simple

472
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,340
Then finally let's talk about a call review

473
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,300
That call review is easy

474
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,620
It's the same as the Git card review

475
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,340
Just say it doesn't help you do the card

476
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,060
It helps you do the call review

477
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,300
That's what it means

478
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,780
OK, let's do the same

479
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,580
Let's take a look at an example

480
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,340
Suppose we let's take a look at this code

481
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,340
OK

482
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,620
Let's go to the PHP file

483
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,340
OK

484
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,380
.php

485
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,380
OK

486
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,380
The same

487
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,660
Let's put the script on

488
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,660
OK, let's take a look at this

489
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,660
This

490
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,660
How to use

491
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,660
.php

492
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,660
CodeGPD

493
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,660
OK

494
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,660
We are

495
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,660
Anyway, just use

496
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,660
Review

497
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,660
We will next review

498
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,660
OK

499
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,660
Next review is the same

500
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,660
He will go to see the content in this stage file

501
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,660
Then he starts to do

502
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,660
ReviewCodeChange

503
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,660
Then this

504
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,660
He needs to spend a period of time

505
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,660
Then you can spray these

506
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,660
These information

507
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,660
In fact, this thing is actually very useful

508
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,660
In the beginning, he told you that he may have some

509
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,660
Some ingestion

510
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,660
So you have to

511
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,660
Go to verify the input

512
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,660
What are you doing

513
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,660
Enter the user card

514
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,660
So I think these

515
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,660
The tools are very useful

516
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,660
He made 5 points for you

517
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,660
He made 5 points for you

518
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,660
So basically

519
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,660
I hope this thing can continue our

520
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,660
RuntyCoverFloor

521
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,660
Every time the user posts pr

522
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,660
For example, your team

523
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,660
The team is posting pr

524
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,660
I automatically

525
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,660
From your

526
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,660
From your this card

527
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,660
All of the content

528
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,660
Go to the code review

529
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,660
Give a summarized

530
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,660
That summarized

531
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,660
For you

532
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,660
Very useful

533
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,660
For the developer

534
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,660
It is very useful to the developer

535
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,660
Then for the reviewer

536
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,660
He can look at this first

537
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,660
He can look at this review

538
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,660
Summoned

539
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,660
You know that you

540
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,660
What are you doing with this whole code

541
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,660
And maybe

542
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,660
What are the problems

543
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,660
What are the problems

544
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,660
And what suggestions

545
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,660
Basically

546
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,660
Usually need to say

547
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,660
He actually has some

548
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,660
Some ingestion

549
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,660
That's not you

550
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,660
But wait for you to fix it

551
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,660
I'll go and see

552
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,660
No problem

553
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,660
So basically

554
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,660
I think the suggestions

555
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,660
The suggestions are very, very good

556
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,660
Not just in

557
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,660
Code

558
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,660
Because he almost

559
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,660
I've finished watching the game

560
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,660
That's the 2021 data

561
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,660
I think that

562
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,660
The whole model base

563
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,660
Has been very, very strong

564
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,660
So basically

565
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,660
He can look at the language

566
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,660
good

567
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,660
That's what I'm going to introduce today

568
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,660
Then I think it's very useful

569
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,660
That's below

570
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,660
good

571
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,660
That's China and Hong Kong

572
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,660
In fact, most companies

573
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,660
Are strict with the CFC

574
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,660
So this tool

575
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,660
I've just developed

576
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,660
Processing function

577
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,660
You can connect with the Sacky

578
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,660
You can use the process

579
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,660
Or visit OpenAI

580
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,660
Or if you have

581
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,660
If you have a base UI

582
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,660
You have a Java or a proxy

583
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,660
It's okay

584
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,660
Well, if you expect

585
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,660
I think the next step

586
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,660
Is the OpenAI

587
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,660
OpenAI

588
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,660
After coming in

589
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,660
He will also support

590
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,660
OpenAI

591
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,660
Because OpenAI

592
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,660
The biggest share is software

593
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,660
Then Microsoft also

594
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,660
This thing is integrated

595
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,660
Into their

596
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,660
The entire cloud service of Agile

597
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,660
So basically

598
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,660
In terms of

599
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,660
Most of the companies

600
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,660
It's impossible to

601
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,660
Go to OpenAI

602
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,660
Because he didn't have the ability

603
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,660
He won't take your data

604
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,660
Do any

605
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,660
The training tool

606
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,660
But Microsoft

607
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,660
He is

608
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,660
This is a possibility

609
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,660
I heard

610
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,660
We will never

611
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,660
Go to the code

612
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,660
Do that

613
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,660
The right thing

614
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,660
This is to sign with Microsoft

615
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,660
The contract later

616
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,660
So this is the

617
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,660
The big company is going to go

618
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,660
Ok

619
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,660
I hope

620
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,660
I hope to introduce this tool today

621
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,660
Is helpful to everyone

622
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,660
If you like it

623
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,660
You can help me to click on the heart

624
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,660
Click on the war

625
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,660
At present, I think it's

626
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,660
A lot of people are using it

627
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,660
So now it's about 300

628
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,660
More people are standing

629
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,660
If you like it

630
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,660
Just help me introduce the propaganda
