00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, everyone, I am Buyi

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,680
This class will introduce a tool called

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,020
Use the TrueGPT automatic development

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,520
Create a coming message

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,640
I will explain three important things later

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,280
The first is why the model is called GBT

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,720
Let's introduce the TrueGPT

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,880
How to use

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,480
Let's talk about the latest one

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,640
I used the new one

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,440
OK

12
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,960
Everyone is not unfamiliar with TrueGPT

13
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,120
Currently, it is AI, AIGC, AI generator content

14
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,800
At present, when the red bomb machine

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,760
All the software development in the world is thinking about

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,760
How to use TrueGPT to help us develop the entire software process

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,760
Or improve our

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,280
Use or environment

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,760
And I am here

20
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,880
The most important thing is to use TrueGPT to help you write

21
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,200
KitKamiMessage

22
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,520
How to write KitKamiMessage

23
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,160
You can refer to this article

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,120
Then I will probably put it below

25
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,600
OK

26
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,360
I am here

27
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,680
I directly use the structure

28
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,480
Write a CEO to provide a code GBT

29
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,920
If you like it, you can share it with me

30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,640
The most important thing is to help the software

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,680
The software control is to organize the content

32
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,440
You can see the effect of code GBT

33
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,400
Create KitKamiMessage

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,000
That is, you write the code today

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,400
You have to organize KitKamiMessage

36
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,880
For example, what does this function do

37
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,440
Or this bug

38
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,200
How to solve it

39
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,560
Then you may want to say

40
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,040
How to write this content

41
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,800
Let everyone check it later

42
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,760
Very good

43
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,400
Then we don't have code GBT

44
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,360
We use AI to help you to see the whole KitKamiMessage

45
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,520
We help to automatically create this content

46
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,720
You see this is the bottom effect

47
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,440
You see all of my KamiMessage

48
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,880
All use this set of tools called code GBT

49
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,720
Help me create

50
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,200
Not me

51
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,400
That's basically

52
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,680
89% is correct

53
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,160
That's basically

54
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,840
You just have to slightly adjust yourself

55
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,520
You can do what you want

56
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,360
So basically if you are

57
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,200
Long time in the code for others

58
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,160
That's also

59
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,280
I hope you write your own KamiMessage

60
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,240
If you have any help

61
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,440
This tool can help you to improve

62
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,440
There are many times

63
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,080
good

64
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
Then

65
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,480
I don't write code GBT

66
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,440
In fact, there are already more than this kind of tools on the GitHub platform

67
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,960
Why do you want to re-develop it

68
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,280
The first one is the cross-platform platform

69
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,720
I need to use the source of the code to distribute it to the private sector

70
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,680
To avoid the different platforms

71
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,960
The different environments

72
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,320
This is easier for developers who do not receive the environment

73
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,320
The second one is that my future plans are to say

74
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,080
After the GitHub, the Git, the Bbac and other Git platforms

75
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,640
After sending PR, you can use the chat GBT

76
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,720
Help you to organize the content of KamiMessage

77
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,920
And the chat

78
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,800
Then this tool

79
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,160
So my development tool is not just for developers

80
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,120
Can automatically produce KamiMessage

81
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,800
In the future, I hope that it can

82
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,040
Can be a tool to help you to do the code review

83
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,240
Then the third reason is

84
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,280
In the future

85
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,800
I hope it's not just the open AI API

86
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
The chat GBT API

87
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,720
Currently in the A9 API

88
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,280
Open AI has been supported

89
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,520
Okay, let's talk about the way to use it

90
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,440
Actually, it's very simple

91
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,400
Every time there will be

92
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,800
Linux Mac OS Windows

93
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,920
Download the corresponding private sector

94
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,840
You just need to download and send it to BIM

95
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,360
Then go to the open AI website

96
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
Then you can create an API key

97
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,960
Every month seems to be free 18 USD

98
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,160
But I think this is already cheap

99
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,560
In fact, every day you know

100
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,880
No matter how much you Kami

101
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,360
Now it's a true GBT 3.5 Turbo version

102
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,720
It's actually very cheap

103
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,920
So basically you

104
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,840
Kami's message

105
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,000
He saw the token number

106
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,280
Actually not even a dollar

107
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,800
It's quite cheap

108
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,520
So everyone put the credit card on it

109
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,560
Because your

110
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,200
For your KamiMessage

111
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,960
Very useful

112
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,080
And you don't have to waste time

113
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,600
To organize your own

114
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,480
Write things

115
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,080
good

116
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,520
Then when you finish

117
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,800
Actually you can use

118
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,880
I don't want to go to Insta

119
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,280
We can take a look

120
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
Let's take a look at this website

121
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,800
good

122
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,240
Very simple

123
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,200
You can download from this list

124
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,880
To the corresponding private sector

125
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,560
You can go

126
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,520
Download the answer

127
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,720
64 with the AND

128
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,080
Or the Linux version

129
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,680
Or the Windows version

130
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,280
Or you

131
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,840
Very simple

132
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,120
If you use Mac

133
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,080
You can use

134
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,120
Just use Blue install

135
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,960
Basically, just use the tab

136
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,440
Apple Boy's stage tab

137
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,200
Then install

138
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,440
Then the next step is

139
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,680
How to use

140
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,480
Set up your API key

141
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,160
Then this is very simple

142
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,560
After you generate your API key

143
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,920
You can continue to use it

144
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,560
You just need to export this variable

145
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,760
Then you will do the back-up thing

146
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,320
good

147
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,040
Let's see how to use it at the bottom

148
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,040
good

149
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,240
Let's take a look

150
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,760
Let's take a look at the current

151
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,040
KamiMessage

152
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,440
good

153
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,400
Because it's here

154
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
I changed one thing

155
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,280
Then let's take a look at

156
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,680
GITDIF

157
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,000
good

158
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,360
Look at me

159
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
After I change this

160
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,600
Let's take a look at what he wants to do

161
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,440
Let's set it to

162
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,480
The third state

163
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:43,720
good

164
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,560
Next we have code gbt

165
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,520
This KamiMessage

166
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,240
You can play hlp

167
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,960
You can see that he has a lot of

168
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
Kami can use

169
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,240
The first Kami

170
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,680
He will help you to auto generate a KamiMessage

171
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,720
Then you can set up your own KamiMessage

172
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,360
Let me introduce this a little more

173
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,680
Then you can also use the GIT hook method to do it

174
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,360
Then this is less useful

175
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,400
If you need it, you can also use it

176
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,560
He will help you to press a GIT hook

177
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,480
At your

178
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,560
At your point

179
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,920
Under the point GIT

180
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,200
To change your Kami hook

181
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,680
Then you can automatically send the message to the user every time you use the KamiMessage

182
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,600
Then he has the most important function

183
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,360
He can go to the remote control

184
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,760
So this is also introduced

185
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,160
Ok

186
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,120
Let's take a look at it

187
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,200
Because we are now in a stage state

188
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,120
There is a

189
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,320
CND

190
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,560
The code is changed by the answer

191
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,760
Let's take a look at the content

192
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,040
Ok, in fact, just change

193
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,960
Change a

194
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,240
The variable of the constant

195
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,160
Change it to a

196
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,520
The order of your own

197
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,720
Ok, then we just use the code gbt

198
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,880
Kami

199
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
So he will automatically use

200
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,920
Gbt 3.5 turbo version

201
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,560
Then he will tell you what is the Kami summary

202
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,600
He will tell you the variable of the update environment

203
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,000
Preface for consistency

204
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,360
Then he will be able to say that the content inside it is

205
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,760
I changed the Github into input

206
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,960
Change the weight to the bottom

207
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,960
The weight of the text

208
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,440
Then after finishing it

209
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,240
He basically wrote it to you

210
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,080
A KamiMessage

211
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,120
He automatically changed it

212
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,360
So you can see

213
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,000
You are automatically changed to this

214
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,920
Ok

215
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,520
Ok

216
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,840
If you are not satisfied with this message

217
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,520
You can use another method

218
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,800
You can go down

219
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,840
This

220
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,120
Then this is actually with your Github Kami

221
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,760
The content is the same

222
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,520
You will go to change the Kami message

223
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,520
Ok, we will do it next

224
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,760
He must be doing

225
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,560
GPD 3.5 turbo version

226
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,240
After that, he will go to change a new message

227
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,120
Ok, until you change

228
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,200
The message you want

229
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,640
The message you want

230
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,520
So you can keep changing

231
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Of course

232
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,280
It's all signed to your

233
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,520
The token money

234
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,480
So you see

235
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,440
Here I tell you

236
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,120
How much is your Pond token

237
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,600
Then how much is your Confirmation token

238
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,880
Then the total token here is these two

239
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,360
That's the last thing you want to pay

240
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,160
Now every 1000 tokens is 0.002 US dollars

241
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,960
That's very cheap

242
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,160
So basically you use it every day

243
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,360
Almost not much

244
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,440
More than 1 US dollars

245
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,680
So you can save every day

246
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,760
Go to the money to order a drink

247
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,360
In fact, you can save a day

248
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,840
How much is your KamiMessage

249
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,200
So I think it's basically

250
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,400
Pretty convenient

251
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,880
How to use other parameters

252
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,200
Let's take a look at the Internet

253
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,720
Ok, then in fact

254
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,040
We can go through a code GPT

255
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,600
Use Confirmation token

256
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,120
Go to set some environmental parameters

257
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,840
For example

258
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,600
Ok, I wrote the Open API in there

259
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,800
Basically, I don't have to go to eSport anymore

260
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,320
Because it will directly win

261
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,360
The store under the screen

262
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,080
Confirmation token

263
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,520
Code GPT store

264
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,400
Code GPT store

265
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,960
The answer is to write in these settings

266
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,880
Then it's all written

267
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,000
So basically you don't have to worry about it

268
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,520
Then what about Open API

269
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,120
Open API has a function

270
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,000
Base

271
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,600
UIL

272
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,840
Why does this function have this function

273
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,520
You see now all companies

274
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,000
Almost all of this

275
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Open API's king is all blocked

276
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,440
After that, everyone is crazy

277
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,600
Crazy fake

278
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,760
For all the plus

279
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,560
For all the plus

280
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,960
You can change this point

281
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,520
Base UIL

282
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,000
Then I guess at the beginning

283
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,200
Open API should have

284
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,400
Found this problem

285
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,720
When the record is released

286
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,320
He told me that he can point

287
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,920
Everyone's base UIL can be changed

288
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,640
So you can change it to what you want

289
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,920
Then everyone can use this free

290
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,320
Then many people will say

291
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
Hey, my key is stolen

292
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,840
What are you doing

293
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,000
If I don't believe it, I'll just go and get it myself

294
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,400
Then this is a Chinese developer

295
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,240
The price

296
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,480
Then it is a Dino developer

297
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,680
Ok, then you can turn some

298
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,760
Some data to the computer

299
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,160
API key and your organization

300
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,960
Just assume that your account has more than one organization

301
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,240
Remember to set this

302
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,920
Ok, then you can use the model you want

303
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,480
Then you can use the GPT 3.5 Turbo now

304
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,040
Or you need a bigger token

305
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,880
Because GPT 3.5

306
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,720
Its token is a token of 409

307
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,480
Then you can change it to GPT4

308
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
Maybe you can use 8K token

309
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,960
Or 32K token

310
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,120
But its cost is

311
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
One is 15 times

312
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,080
One is 30 times

313
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,560
So everyone, be careful

314
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,720
If you need it

315
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,200
But basically if you just want to do

316
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,080
Carman's Bureau and Review Code

317
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,400
GPT 3.5 Turbo

318
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,800
It's very, very useful

319
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,560
Then in terms of language

320
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,960
You basically have the language

321
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,040
You can change your Carman's Bureau to

322
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,320
Chinese

323
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,400
Translate Chinese, sign language, and Japanese

324
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,200
The purpose is to change these three types

325
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,440
Then I have a more written

326
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,400
Plastic function

327
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,120
Or Saki's house to make links

328
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,800
So you

329
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,800
You have been doing these Saki and Plastic

330
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,560
You can connect it in this way

331
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,280
This is the UI of OpenAI

332
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,880
Ok, then this is the Type-Out

333
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,480
This Type-Out is to assume that your

334
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,320
Carman's Bureau

335
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,920
Your token needs to look a lot

336
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,680
Sometimes

337
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,160
OpenAI will be noisy because

338
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,280
OpenAI is too much to use

339
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,920
So sometimes it will be very slow

340
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,160
So you just adjust the Type-Out

341
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,080
Ok, then there is Miss Token

342
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,200
This token is that

343
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,800
When you reply

344
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,840
These words are too

345
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,480
Compression Token

346
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,080
If you don't use Compression Token

347
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,400
If you don't use it, you can increase it from here

348
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,760
That default is 300

349
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,400
But the main thing is to adjust this

350
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,360
Because you need this when you are doing the Code Review

351
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,040
Ok

352
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,920
Ok, then there is Temperature

353
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,920
But this is the basic

354
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,960
The parameters of OpenAI

355
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,160
0.7

356
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,040
0.0 to 0.2

357
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,360
Then the higher you are, the higher the answer

358
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,840
So don't be too high or too low

359
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,160
So 0.7 should be

360
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,200
This is the parameters of the network

361
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,680
Ok, then there is a called

362
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,640
Diff Unify

363
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,360
This thing

364
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,680
I will introduce this

365
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,120
You can look at it

366
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,760
Sometimes I put this command

367
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,920
Ok, that's it

368
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,000
You will see that

369
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,440
My Diffnet has

370
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,240
The front and the back three are all connected

371
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,960
This is the thing that the Diff is expected to be

372
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,360
But your Diffnet

373
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,320
So it looks like this in the Diff

374
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,280
That's what your Diff is

375
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,360
If you put this Unify as a 0

376
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,440
Basically

377
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,800
It will only show this red and green

378
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,920
We can try

379
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,640
Ok, there is a

380
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,680
There is a Diff thing on the Diff

381
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,120
Ok, anyway, this is

382
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,680
This parameter is basically to adjust

383
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,720
Can you think about it?

384
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,400
He adjusts it

385
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,040
Do you want to see the front row and the back row

386
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,440
The prediction is three rows

387
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,960
So basically you adjust it

388
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,360
We give it to token

389
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,680
We give it to OpenAI

390
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,480
You can reduce the token amount

391
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,480
So this is also the benefit of reducing the token amount

392
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
So if your

393
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,680
Your Ruminant is very long

394
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,880
Basically you can adjust it a little

395
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,720
It will save some tokens

396
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
Then basically I think you can set it as 0

397
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,560
Because

398
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,400
Basically OpenAI is looking at the front

399
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:27,960
These are the few

400
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,800
The whole answer to the back row is not very impressive

401
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,120
So basically I set it as 0

402
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,880
Ok

403
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,280
Then there is the Is Coolist

404
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,520
I think this is also very useful

405
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,200
What does this thing use

406
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
If you change things

407
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,760
For example, the package.json

408
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,960
The package is

409
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,800
NPN

410
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,560
NPN

411
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,520
ConfirDock.json

412
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,600
That actually doesn't use anything

413
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,120
Or the "go" in "go"

414
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,040
For example, this "go go"

415
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,680
This thing actually doesn't use anything

416
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,400
Then send it to OpenAI

417
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,880
It also saves the token amount

418
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,800
So basically I will choose this one

419
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,400
So

420
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,200
If it's similar, it's like this

421
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,600
Ok

422
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,120
For example, like this

423
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,800
I set it as "nima"

424
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,720
"diff unify"

425
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,000
Then this "iscoolist"

426
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,840
I set it as "nitetestify"

427
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,960
That basically doesn't mean anything

428
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,360
We don't want to give OpenAI

429
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,040
We don't want to give AI to look

430
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,720
But it's in this "common"

431
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,440
"common.nl"

432
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,920
We can just drop it

433
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,920
Basically this is the parameters

434
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,520
So this is what we just talked about

435
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,040
It can do

436
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,520
"common" preview

437
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,480
You can also drop the preview

438
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,360
The preview means that I won't

439
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,920
Do this "common.nl"

440
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,040
Help you do "common"

441
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,920
Then you basically

442
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,760
"Standify" is still there

443
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,840
Then this is to help you translate

444
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,840
Basically don't use this function

445
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,040
Don't translate the whole Chinese

446
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,440
Because the token amount of Chinese is quite large

447
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,240
So everyone please use it

448
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,880
Then this is

449
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,800
Just demoed

450
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,240
Suppose you are not satisfied with the message of the previous "common.nl"

451
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,120
You can keep downloading this command

452
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,600
You can continue to modify the last "common.nl"

453
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,840
Then there was a user who told me before

454
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,680
This "common.nl" format can be slightly changed

455
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,760
No problem

456
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,320
You can define this "template"

457
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,880
There are several parameters

458
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,040
Summary of P-fix

459
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,080
Summary of Title

460
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,120
Summary of Message

461
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,760
You can use it

462
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,840
So you can download a

463
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,760
"templar_stream"

464
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,160
To change these things

465
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,320
Or "templar_fire"

466
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,120
You can set it up

467
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,560
Okay, I won't talk about "key" here

468
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
It's very simple

469
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,480
Install and uninstall

470
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,160
Then you can

471
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,240
"git_add"

472
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,160
After these "fire"

473
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,280
Then download "git_cami"

474
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,880
It will jump out of a window

475
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,960
"common.nl" window

476
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,840
Then download the "common.nl" that "ai" is generated

477
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,440
So you see it is generated

478
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,760
It will help you do "common"

479
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,280
Okay, so it's very simple

480
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Then finally let's talk about a "call review"

481
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,240
That "call review" is very simple

482
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,560
It's the same as "git_common.nl"

483
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,360
Just say it doesn't help you do "common"

484
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,960
It helps you do "call review"

485
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,280
That's what it means

486
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,560
Okay, let's see another example

487
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,200
Suppose we come and take a look at this

488
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,840
Okay

489
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,560
Let's listen to that PHP file

490
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,320
Okay

491
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,320
"common.phe"

492
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
Okay

493
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
Then the same

494
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,560
Let's put the string up

495
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,520
Okay, let's take a look at this

496
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
This

497
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
How to use

498
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,040
"call_gbt"

499
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,720
Okay

500
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,760
We are

501
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,960
Anyway, we only have

502
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,680
"review"

503
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,120
Let's just do the next "review"

504
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,200
Okay

505
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,000
After the next "review"

506
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,960
It will go to see the content of this "stage file"

507
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,000
Then it will start to do "review call change"

508
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,440
Then this is probably

509
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,560
It needs to take a while

510
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,760
Then you can spray these

511
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,720
These details

512
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,840
In fact, this thing is actually very useful

513
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,400
The "challenge"

514
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,360
It tells you that

515
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,680
It may have some

516
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,920
Some "ingestion"

517
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,000
So you have to

518
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,560
To verify your input

519
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,360
What is it

520
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,920
Enter the "share"

521
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,160
So I think these

522
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,080
The tools are very useful

523
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,520
It's got five points for you

524
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,720
It's got five points for you

525
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,360
So basically I hope this thing

526
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,960
Can continue our

527
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,360
"Renewing the software flow"

528
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,040
Every time the user posts a PR

529
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,160
For example, your team

530
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,640
The team is posting a PR

531
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,840
I automatically

532
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,000
From your

533
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,240
From your "Kami"

534
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,000
All the content

535
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,120
Go to do a "call review"

536
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,480
Give a "summarize"

537
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,640
That "summarize"

538
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,280
Is very useful to you

539
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,240
It's very useful to the developer itself

540
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,680
It's very useful to the developer

541
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,640
Then for the "review"

542
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,120
He can look at this first

543
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,440
He can look at this "review"

544
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,240
Summarize you will know that

545
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,040
Hey, you

546
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,200
What are you doing with this whole "call"

547
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,840
And what are the problems that may occur

548
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,760
What are the problems that occur

549
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,000
And what suggestions do you give

550
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,760
Basically

551
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,800
Usually it needs to say

552
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,840
Hey, he actually has some

553
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,680
Some "intuition"

554
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,960
That's not you

555
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,120
But do you want to wait for you to finish

556
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
I'll go and see

557
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,000
No problem

558
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,840
So basically I think

559
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,240
The suggestions given by AI are very, very useful

560
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,200
Not just in

561
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,440
"call-review"

562
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,080
In PHP

563
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,120
Look at it from a distance

564
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,360
He looks a lot

565
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,000
Because he's almost finished looking at the "keyhabagore"

566
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,360
That's the 2021 data

567
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,560
Then I think that

568
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,920
The whole model base

569
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,320
Has been very, very powerful

570
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,040
So basically

571
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,560
He can look at the language

572
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,880
good

573
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,000
Then this is the tool I'm going to introduce today

574
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,080
Then I think it's very useful

575
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,160
Then below is

576
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,760
that

577
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,800
good

578
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,040
That's China and Hong Kong

579
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,160
In fact, most companies

580
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,960
Are strict with the CPMC

581
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,200
So this tool

582
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,360
I'm just going to

583
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,680
Just develop the process function

584
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,160
You can connect it to the Sacky method

585
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,680
You can connect it to the Sacky method

586
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,840
Or go

587
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,120
Ask OpenAI

588
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,760
Or if you have a base UI

589
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,200
If you have a "for all possible"

590
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,160
It's okay

591
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,600
good

592
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,360
Then if you expect

593
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,760
I think the next step is

594
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,040
OpenAI for Azure

595
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,080
After coming in

596
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,240
He will support Azure OpenAI

597
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,640
Because OpenAI

598
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,760
The biggest share is software

599
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,840
That software is also

600
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,440
This thing is integrated into their

601
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,960
Azure

602
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,800
The whole cloud service is there

603
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,520
So basically

604
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,960
In terms of us

605
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,880
Most of the companies

606
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,040
It's impossible to work with OpenAI

607
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,840
Because he has no ability to say

608
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,920
He won't take your data

609
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,400
Do any of the full-time operations

610
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,320
But software

611
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,280
He is in this aspect

612
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,600
Is there a possibility to say

613
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,000
Hey, we will never go where

614
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,960
Code to do that

615
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,360
This is what we have to do with the future

616
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,920
Sign the contract later

617
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,480
So this is the big company

618
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,880
The right way to go

619
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,480
good

620
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,120
I hope

621
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,560
I hope that the introduction of this tool

622
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,440
Is helpful to everyone

623
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,440
If you like it

624
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,600
You can help me to click

625
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,840
Click on the "subscribe"

626
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,600
At present

627
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,360
Actually, I think it's quite a lot of people using it

628
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,280
So now it's probably more than 300 people

629
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,120
If you like it

630
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,920
Just help me introduce or promote

631
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,840
Thank you all
