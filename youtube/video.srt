Welcome to English in a Minute. Most people enjoy going to parties. You get to be around

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:16,240
friends, eat food, and maybe listen to music. But do your parties ever have animals?

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,240
Party animal.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,480
Hey Jonathan, are you as ready as I am for the weekend?

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,920
Oh yeah. I'm going to my brother's birthday party on Friday. My cousin is having her graduation

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,680
party Saturday and I'm hosting the karaoke party on Sunday.

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,000
Wow, you are quite the party animal, aren't you?

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,440
That's nothing. You should have seen me in college.

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:49,480
A party animal is not an actual animal. It is a person who really enjoys going to parties.

10
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:56,640
Most of their time is spent finding out where the latest and best party is going to be.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,980
And that's English in a minute.

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,560
(upbeat music)
