0s,2s,"Hello everyone, I am V"
2s,4s,"This class introduces a tool to everyone"
4s,7s,"Called using Chord GPT to automatically help developers"
7s,9s,"Produce commit manager"
9s,11s,"Ok, I will explain to you later"
11s,13s,"Three main points, the first one is why I write"
13s,14s,"Code GPT"
14s,17s,"The second one we introduce Chord GPT"
17s,18s,"How to use"
18s,21s,"Then we will talk about the performance of my use"
21s,24s,"Ok, everyone should not be unfamiliar with Chord GPT"
24s,28s,"That is currently AI, AI GC, AI Generator, Content"
28s,31s,"At present, when the red bomb is in the world"
31s,33s,"The software development engineers all think"
33s,36s,"How to use Chord GPT to help us develop"
36s,39s,"The entire software process or improve our"
39s,41s,"Use or environment"
41s,44s,"And I am here mainly to use Chord GPT"
44s,46s,"To help you write Git commit manager"
46s,48s,"How to write Git commit manager"
48s,50s,"You can refer to this article"
50s,52s,"Then I may put it in the following link"
52s,54s,"Ok, I'm here, I'm using Go"
54s,57s,"Written a CL tool called Code GPT"
57s,1m0s,"If you like, you can share it with me"
1m0s,1m3s,"In fact, the main point is to help the software development engineer"
1m3s,1m4s,"To organize the development content"
1m4s,1m6s,"You can see Code GPT"
1m6s,1m8s,"Produce commit manager effect"
1m8s,1m11s,"That is, when you write all the codes today"
1m11s,1m13s,"You have to write to organize the commit manager"
1m13s,1m15s,"After you say what this function does"
1m15s,1m18s,"Or how do I solve this bug"
1m18s,1m20s,"Then today you may think about how to go"
1m20s,1m23s,"Write this content that makes everyone"
1m23s,1m25s,"I was very touched when I came to check"
1m25s,1m27s,"Then we use Chord GPT"
1m27s,1m29s,"We use AI to help you see the whole"
1m29s,1m31s,"After the Git diff content"
1m31s,1m33s,"Let's help to automatically generate this message"
1m33s,1m35s,"You see this is the bottom effect"
1m35s,1m38s,"You can see all my commands here"
1m38s,1m40s,"All use this tool called Chord GPT"
1m40s,1m41s,"Help me generate it"
1m41s,1m42s,"Not written by me"
1m42s,1m45s,"In fact, basically, 80% to 90% are correct"
1m45s,1m47s,"Basically, you just have to slightly adjust yourself"
1m47s,1m49s,"You can do the effect you want"
1m49s,1m51s,"So basically if you are"
1m51s,1m53s,"I've been sending other people's codes for a long time"
1m53s,1m55s,"I also hope that the commitment message you wrote"
1m55s,1m57s,"Is helpful to the team"
1m57s,1m59s,"This tool can help you improve"
1m59s,2m1s,"Reduce a lot of time"
2m1s,2m4s,"Ok, why do we write Chord GPT?"
2m4s,2m6s,"In fact, the GitHub platform has already"
2m6s,2m7s,"There are many similar tools"
2m7s,2m9s,"Why do you have to redevelop again"
2m9s,2m10s,"The first is cross-platform"
2m10s,2m13s,"I need to use the fast-release and self-sufficient block"
2m13s,2m15s,"Avoid different platforms and install different environments"
2m15s,2m17s,"This is for developers who are unfamiliar with the environment"
2m17s,2m18s,"Can be easier to install"
2m18s,2m20s,"The second is that my future plan is"
2m20s,2m23s,"The following GitHub, Github, Bitbucker, etc."
2m23s,2m24s,"After sending the PR"
2m24s,2m26s,"You can automatically help through Chord GPT"
2m26s,2m28s,"Help you sort out the content of the code"
2m28s,2m30s,"And automatically leave a message"
2m30s,2m32s,"So this tool"
2m32s,2m33s,"So my developer tool is not just"
2m33s,2m36s,"Let developers generate their own commitments"
2m36s,2m37s,"In the future, I hope to be able to"
2m37s,2m39s,"Can be integrated"
2m39s,2m41s,"Help to carry out the code review"
2m41s,2m43s,"The third reason is that in the future"
2m43s,2m46s,"I hope it's not just the open AI API"
2m46s,2m48s,"Chord GPT API"
2m48s,2m50s,"Currently in the A9 API"
2m50s,2m51s,"OpenAI has been supported"
2m51s,2m53s,"Ok, let's talk about the usage now"
2m53s,2m54s,"Actually very simple"
2m54s,2m56s,"Every time the output will be"
2m56s,2m58s,"Linux Mac OS Windows download"
2m58s,3m0s,"Relative execution"
3m0s,3m2s,"You just download it and put it in Bin"
3m2s,3m5s,"Then go to the OpenAI website and create an API key"
3m5s,3m8s,"The first month seems to be free of $18"
3m8s,3m10s,"But I think this is already cheap"
3m10s,3m11s,"In fact, every day you only"
3m11s,3m13s,"No matter how much you commit"
3m13s,3m15s,"Now is Chord GPT 3.5 Turbo version"
3m15s,3m16s,"It's actually very cheap"
3m16s,3m19s,"So basically you commit a message a day"
3m19s,3m22s,"Look at the amount of token he has seen"
3m22s,3m23s,"Actually less than a dollar"
3m23s,3m24s,"Pretty cheap"
3m24s,3m25s,"So everyone put the new version on"
3m25s,3m28s,"Because it's very useful for you to write a commitment"
3m28s,3m30s,"And you don't have to waste time"
3m30s,3m33s,"Go and sort out what you have written"
3m33s,3m35s,"Ok, after everyone has done it"
3m35s,3m38s,"In fact, you can use Blue to install"
3m38s,3m39s,"We can take a look"
3m39s,3m41s,"Let's take a look at this page"
3m44s,3m47s,"It's easy for you to download from this release"
3m47s,3m49s,"To the corresponding execution"
3m49s,3m53s,"You can download the Darwin ARM64 and AMD DOS"
3m53s,3m54s,"Or the Linux version"
3m54s,3m55s,"Or the Windows version"
3m55s,3m58s,"Or you can say you are very simple"
3m58s,3m59s,"If you use Mac"
3m59s,4m3s,"You can just use Blue Install"
4m3s,4m5s,"Basically Blue Tab"
4m5s,4m6s,"Apple Boy/Tab"
4m6s,4m8s,"Then install"
4m8s,4m11s,"Then the next step is how to use"
4m11s,4m13s,"Setup your API key"
4m13s,4m14s,"This is very simple"
4m14s,4m15s,"After producing your API key"
4m15s,4m17s,"You can use it yourself"
4m17s,4m18s,"After you go to the export variable"
4m18s,4m21s,"Then you will do the post-release self-release"
4m21s,4m23s,"Let's see how to use it below"
4m23s,4m25s,"Let's take a look"
4m25s,4m29s,"Let's take a look at the current content"
4m29s,4m30s,"Because he is here"
4m30s,4m32s,"I changed something"
4m32s,4m33s,"Then we take a look"
4m33s,4m35s,"git diff"
4m35s,4m38s,"After you see me change this"
4m38s,4m40s,"Let's take a look at it next"
4m40s,4m41s,"How to do it"
4m41s,4m43s,"Let's reset it to the previous state"
4m43s,4m45s,"Ok, next we have code gpt"
4m45s,4m46s,"This command line"
4m46s,4m48s,"You can hit hlp"
4m48s,4m51s,"You can see that he has a lot of commands to use"
4m51s,4m52s,"The first one is the command"
4m52s,4m54s,"He will help you to auto-generate the command mesh"
4m54s,4m56s,"Then you can set your own commands"
4m56s,4m58s,"Let me introduce this a little bit"
4m58s,5m1s,"Then you can also use the git hook method to do it"
5m1s,5m3s,"This is less used"
5m3s,5m5s,"If you need it, you can also use it"
5m5s,5m7s,"He will help you install a git hook"
5m7s,5m11s,"Under your git"
5m11s,5m13s,"To improve your command hook"
5m13s,5m15s,"That command hook is when you command every time"
5m15s,5m17s,"He will automatically help you generate these messages"
5m17s,5m19s,"Then he has the most important function"
5m19s,5m21s,"He can review your code"
5m21s,5m23s,"So this will be introduced later"
5m23s,5m24s,"Let's take a look"
5m24s,5m26s,"Because we are now in a stage state"
5m26s,5m28s,"There is a cmd.go"
5m28s,5m29s,"When this file has been changed"
5m29s,5m31s,"Let's take a look at the content"
5m31s,5m35s,"Actually, it's just a"
5m35s,5m37s,"Change a const to a"
5m37s,5m39s,"Change it to a self-defined branch"
5m39s,5m41s,"Then we just use the code gpt"
5m41s,5m43s,"Kami"
5m43s,5m45s,"In this way, he will automatically use"
5m45s,5m47s,"After the gpt 3.5 turbo version"
5m47s,5m49s,"Next he told you that"
5m49s,5m50s,"What is the summary of the kami"
5m50s,5m51s,"He told you that"
5m51s,5m52s,"Updating environment variable"
5m52s,5m54s,"Preface for consistency"
5m54s,5m55s,"Then he told you that"
5m55s,5m57s,"The content inside is"
5m57s,5m59s,"I changed the github to input"
5m59s,6m1s,"Change the zone to the bottom"
6m1s,6m3s,"Then after completion"
6m3s,6m5s,"Basically, it will help you write a kami message"
6m5s,6m6s,"Automatically help you kami"
6m6s,6m7s,"So you see"
6m7s,6m10s,"You are automatically changed to this"
6m10s,6m11s,"good"
6m11s,6m13s,"If you are to this"
6m13s,6m15s,"If you are not satisfied with this message"
6m15s,6m17s,"You can use another way"
6m17s,6m18s,"You can go down"
6m18s,6m19s,"This"
6m19s,6m21s,"This is actually with your github"
6m21s,6m22s,"The content is the same"
6m22s,6m23s,"You will go to the last one"
6m23s,6m25s,"Kami message"
6m25s,6m26s,"After we go down"
6m26s,6m27s,"He must execute"
6m27s,6m29s,"gpt 3.5 turbo version"
6m29s,6m30s,"After completing the command"
6m30s,6m31s,"He will go"
6m31s,6m32s,"Change a new message"
6m32s,6m33s,"Good"
6m33s,6m34s,"Until you change to"
6m34s,6m35s,"What you want"
6m35s,6m36s,"The message you want"
6m36s,6m38s,"So you can keep changing"
6m38s,6m39s,"Of course"
6m39s,6m42s,"This is the money that is linked to your calculation token"
6m42s,6m43s,"So you see"
6m43s,6m44s,"I told you here"
6m44s,6m45s,"Your"
6m45s,6m47s,"How much is the Pong token used"
6m47s,6m48s,"Then your"
6m48s,6m49s,"How much is the Confession token used"
6m49s,6m52s,"Then the total token here is these two added"
6m52s,6m53s,"That is the last"
6m53s,6m54s,"You may have to pay the most"
6m54s,6m57s,"Now every 1000 tokens is 0.002 US dollars"
6m57s,6m58s,"That is very cheap"
6m58s,6m59s,"So basically you every day"
6m59s,7m0s,"No matter how much you use"
7m0s,7m2s,"Almost less than a dollar"
7m2s,7m4s,"So you can save"
7m4s,7m5s,"Go to the bank every day"
7m5s,7m6s,"Money for drinks"
7m6s,7m8s,"In fact, you can save your money every day"
7m8s,7m10s,"How much time is the time to Kami message"
7m10s,7m11s,"So I think it's basically"
7m11s,7m12s,"It's pretty convenient"
7m12s,7m14s,"What about the other parameters"
7m14s,7m15s,"Let's take a look at the content of the website"
7m15s,7m16s,"How to use"
7m16s,7m17s,"it is good"
7m17s,7m19s,"Then we can actually use a code"
7m19s,7m21s,"Gpt to use"
7m21s,7m22s,"Confession this paper"
7m22s,7m24s,"To save some environment elements"
7m24s,7m25s,"For example"
7m25s,7m26s,"Okay, I put the open API key"
7m26s,7m27s,"After writing in"
7m27s,7m29s,"Basically, I don't have to go to the e-sport anymore"
7m29s,7m31s,"Because it will directly occupy the"
7m31s,7m33s,"The e-converter under the home screen"
7m33s,7m35s,"The code of the code gpt"
7m35s,7m36s,"Code gpt.yaml"
7m36s,7m38s,"Go write these parameters in"
7m38s,7m39s,"Then it automatically writes"
7m39s,7m41s,"So basically you don't have to worry too much"
7m41s,7m42s,"Then again"
7m42s,7m43s,"OpenAi"
7m43s,7m44s,"It has a parameter"
7m44s,7m45s,"Base bottom line ul"
7m45s,7m47s,"Why is this parameter here"
7m47s,7m48s,"The reason is this"
7m48s,7m49s,"You see all companies now"
7m49s,7m51s,"Almost all of this"
7m51s,7m53s,"OpenAi's website is blocked"
7m53s,7m54s,"Then after blocking"
7m54s,7m55s,"Everyone is crazy"
7m55s,7m57s,"Pretend for world policy"
7m57s,7m58s,"For world policy"
7m58s,7m59s,"You can go to this"
7m59s,8m0s,"Change the base url"
8m0s,8m1s,"Then I guess"
8m1s,8m4s,"OpenAi should have found this problem"
8m4s,8m5s,"When it was released"
8m5s,8m7s,"He told me"
8m7s,8m8s,"He can click"
8m8s,8m10s,"Then his base url can be changed"
8m10s,8m11s,"So you can change it to what you want"
8m11s,8m14s,"Then everyone can use this free"
8m14s,8m15s,"Then many people think"
8m15s,8m17s,"Then my key was stolen"
8m17s,8m18s,"What are you doing"
8m18s,8m20s,"If you don't believe it, just add it yourself"
8m20s,8m22s,"Then this is a Chinese developer"
8m22s,8m23s,"Assume"
8m23s,8m25s,"Then he is a Dino developer"
8m25s,8m27s,"Okay, then you can put some"
8m27s,8m29s,"Some data to the developer"
8m29s,8m30s,"API key"
8m30s,8m32s,"And your organization"
8m32s,8m33s,"Assume your account"
8m33s,8m35s,"There are more than one organization"
8m35s,8m36s,"Remember to set this"
8m36s,8m38s,"Okay, then you may want to use the model"
8m38s,8m39s,"Which one"
8m39s,8m41s,"Then you can use gbt3.5"
8m41s,8m42s,"Turbo or"
8m42s,8m44s,"You need more tokens"
8m44s,8m45s,"Because gbt3.5"
8m45s,8m46s,"His token value is"
8m46s,8m47s,"409 tokens"
8m47s,8m49s,"Then you change to gbt4"
8m49s,8m51s,"Maybe you can use 8k tokens"
8m51s,8m53s,"Or 32k tokens"
8m53s,8m55s,"But its cost is"
8m55s,8m56s,"One is 15 times"
8m56s,8m57s,"One is 30 times"
8m57s,8m59s,"So please be careful if you need to use it"
8m59s,9m1s,"If you just want to do"
9m1s,9m3s,"Commendations and review codes"
9m3s,9m5s,"Gbt3.5's Terminal is very useful"
9m5s,9m7s,"Then in terms of language"
9m7s,9m9s,"You basically use English"
9m9s,9m11s,"You can change your command"
9m11s,9m12s,"into"
9m12s,9m13s,"Chinese"
9m13s,9m15s,"Finding Chinese and Chinese and Japanese are all possible"
9m15s,9m17s,"The goal is to install these three"
9m17s,9m19s,"Then I wrote more here"
9m19s,9m20s,"A plus function"
9m20s,9m22s,"Or the sake method to do some"
9m22s,9m24s,"So you have to do these"
9m24s,9m26s,"If you do these sake and pos, you can"
9m26s,9m29s,"You can connect this openAI UI through this method"
9m29s,9m31s,"Then it's time out"
9m31s,9m33s,"This time out is your commitment"
9m33s,9m36s,"If you need to see a lot of your tokens"
9m36s,9m38s,"Sometimes openAI will be noisy"
9m38s,9m39s,"Because openAI is too much"
9m39s,9m41s,"So sometimes it will be very slow"
9m41s,9m43s,"So you can just turn this time out high"
9m43s,9m44s,"Then it's next"
9m44s,9m45s,"Missed token"
9m45s,9m46s,"This token means"
9m46s,9m48s,"When you reply"
9m48s,9m50s,"These words are also included in this"
9m50s,9m51s,"Composition token"
9m51s,9m53s,"Then suppose you have your compression token"
9m53s,9m55s,"If it's not enough, you can increase it from here"
9m55s,9m57s,"Default is 300"
9m57s,9m59s,"But the main reason for adjusting this is"
9m59s,10m1s,"Because you need this when you are doing code review"
10m1s,10m3s,"it is good"
10m3s,10m5s,"Then there is temperature"
10m5s,10m8s,"This is the basic parameter of openAI"
10m8s,10m9s,"0.7"
10m9s,10m12s,"0.0 between 0 to 2"
10m12s,10m14s,"The higher you are, the more the answer is"
10m14s,10m16s,"So don't be too high and don't be too low"
10m16s,10m17s,"So the answer is 0.7"
10m17s,10m19s,"This is the parameter of everyone on the Internet"
10m19s,10m21s,"There is another one called"
10m21s,10m23s,"GIF Unify"
10m23s,10m25s,"I want to introduce this"
10m25s,10m26s,"You can take a look"
10m26s,10m28s,"For example, I put this in"
10m28s,10m29s,"Ok, that's it"
10m29s,10m30s,"You will see that"
10m30s,10m31s,"I have this GIF content"
10m31s,10m33s,"It has the front three and the back three"
10m33s,10m34s,"List out"
10m34s,10m36s,"This is what Git predicts"
10m36s,10m38s,"But your GIF content"
10m38s,10m40s,"So it looks like this in GIF"
10m40s,10m42s,"What about your GIF"
10m42s,10m44s,"If you set this Unify to 0"
10m44s,10m46s,"Basically it will only list"
10m46s,10m48s,"What about this red and green"
10m48s,10m50s,"We can try"
10m51s,10m53s,"Basically it has a"
10m53s,10m55s,"There is a GIF thing"
10m55s,10m57s,"Anyway, this is"
10m57s,10m59s,"This parameter is basically adjusting"
10m59s,11m1s,"You can adjust it"
11m1s,11m3s,"I want to see the front few rows"
11m3s,11m5s,"With the back few rows"
11m5s,11m6s,"The preset is three rows"
11m6s,11m8s,"So basically you adjust that"
11m8s,11m9s,"We give it to the token"
11m9s,11m10s,"If we give it to openAI"
11m10s,11m12s,"You can reduce the amount of token"
11m12s,11m14s,"So this is also a benefit of reducing the amount of token"
11m14s,11m15s,"So if you"
11m15s,11m17s,"Your review content is very long"
11m17s,11m19s,"Basically you can adjust it a little"
11m19s,11m21s,"You can reduce some tokens"
11m21s,11m23s,"Basically I think it can be set to 0"
11m23s,11m24s,"because"
11m24s,11m26s,"Basically openAI is"
11m26s,11m28s,"The front few and the back few"
11m28s,11m30s,"There is no big impact on the entire answer"
11m30s,11m32s,"So basically I set it to 0"
11m32s,11m35s,"Ok, then it's Coolist"
11m35s,11m37s,"Ok, I think this is also very, very useful"
11m37s,11m39s,"What is this thing used for"
11m39s,11m40s,"Suppose you change something"
11m40s,11m42s,"For example, that package.json"
11m42s,11m44s,"Package is"
11m44s,11m46s,"npm"
11m46s,11m47s,"npm,conf,json"
11m47s,11m49s,"That's actually useless"
11m49s,11m50s,"Or in the Go"
11m50s,11m52s,"For example, this is the point of Go"
11m52s,11m54s,"This thing is actually useless"
11m54s,11m55s,"Then send it in"
11m55s,11m57s,"OpenAI also occupies the amount of token"
11m57s,11m59s,"So basically I will choose this"
11m59s,12m1s,"So if it's similar, it's like this"
12m1s,12m4s,"Ok, let me think about it"
12m4s,12m5s,"For example, like this"
12m5s,12m7s,"I set it to 0"
12m7s,12m8s,"diff unify"
12m8s,12m9s,"Then this is Coolist"
12m9s,12m11s,"I set it, for example, you have test file"
12m11s,12m13s,"Basically, it's useless"
12m13s,12m15s,"We don't give it to openAI"
12m15s,12m17s,"We don't give it to openAI"
12m17s,12m19s,"But it's in this commit"
12m19s,12m21s,"We can just filter it out"
12m21s,12m23s,"Basically, these parameters"
12m23s,12m25s,"So this is what we just talked about"
12m25s,12m26s,"It can do"
12m26s,12m27s,"Commit Preview"
12m27s,12m29s,"You can also add Preview"
12m29s,12m31s,"Preview means that I don't put"
12m31s,12m32s,"This time"
12m32s,12m34s,"Commit on Commit"
12m34s,12m35s,"Commit for you"
12m35s,12m37s,"Then you basically have your stage file"
12m37s,12m38s,"Still there"
12m38s,12m40s,"Then this is to help you translate"
12m40s,12m42s,"Basically don't use this function"
12m42s,12m44s,"Don't translate it into Chinese"
12m44s,12m46s,"Because the amount of token in Chinese is quite large"
12m46s,12m48s,"So please use it carefully"
12m48s,12m50s,"Then this is what I just demonstrated"
12m50s,12m52s,"If you are not satisfied with the previous commit"
12m52s,12m54s,"If you are not satisfied with the message"
12m54s,12m55s,"If you are not satisfied with the message"
12m55s,12m57s,"You can always put this command"
12m57s,12m59s,"You can always modify the last commit"
12m59s,13m0s,"Then again"
13m0s,13m2s,"Before there was a user who told me"
13m2s,13m4s,"Hey, can you change the format of this commit?"
13m4s,13m5s,"No problem"
13m5s,13m7s,"You can define this template"
13m7s,13m9s,"There are a total of several parameters"
13m9s,13m10s,"Summary Preview"
13m10s,13m11s,"Summary Title"
13m11s,13m12s,"Summary Message"
13m12s,13m13s,"You can use"
13m13s,13m14s,"So you can add a"
13m14s,13m15s,"Timbre Stream"
13m15s,13m16s,"To change this thing"
13m16s,13m17s,"Or Timbre Fire"
13m17s,13m19s,"You can set it up"
13m19s,13m40.38s,"Good, I won't talk about the Git"
13m40.38s,13m42.38s,"Call review is actually the same as Git commit"
13m42.38s,13m44.38s,"Just that he doesn't help you make a commit"
13m44.38s,13m46.38s,"He helps you do call review"
13m46.38s,13m47.38s,"This is what it means"
13m47.38s,13m48.38s,"Ok, then we are the same"
13m48.38s,13m50.38s,"Let's take a look at an example"
13m50.38s,13m52.38s,"Let's say we look at this call"
13m52.38s,13m55.38s,"Ok, let's add a PHP file"
13m55.38s,13m58.38s,"Ok, man.p hp"
13m58.38s,14m2.38s,"Ok, then we write it down"
14m2.38s,14m4.38s,"Ok, next we take a look at this"
14m4.38s,14m7.38s,"How to use this"
14m7.38s,14m11.38s,"Call gpt"
14m11.38s,14m13.38s,"Ok, we are"
14m13.38s,14m15.38s,"Anyway, only review"
14m15.38s,14m17.38s,"We will review next"
14m17.38s,14m18.38s,"After reviewing next"
14m18.38s,14m21.38s,"He went to see the content in this stage file"
14m21.38s,14m24.38s,"Then he started to do the review call change"
14m24.38s,14m25.38s,"This is really"
14m25.38s,14m27.38s,"He needs to spend some time"
14m27.38s,14m30.38s,"Then you can spray these messages"
14m30.38s,14m32.38s,"Actually, this thing is actually very useful"
14m32.38s,14m35.38s,"He will tell you that he may have some"
14m35.38s,14m37.38s,"Some ingressions"
14m37.38s,14m39.38s,"So you have to go to verify your input"
14m39.38s,14m40.38s,"What is it with"
14m40.38s,14m41.38s,"Enter the user's account"
14m41.38s,14m44.38s,"So I think these tools are very useful"
14m44.38s,14m45.38s,"He listed five points for you"
14m45.38s,14m46.38s,"He listed five points for you"
14m46.38s,14m48.38s,"So basically I hope this thing"
14m48.38s,14m51.38s,"Can continue our software development flow"
14m51.38s,14m53.38s,"Every time the user sends a PR"
14m53.38s,14m55.38s,"For example, when your team colleague sends a PR"
14m55.38s,14m57.38s,"I automatically"
14m57.38s,14m58.38s,"From your"
14m58.38s,15m0.38s,"From your whole content of this commit"
15m0.38s,15m1.38s,"To do call review"
15m1.38s,15m2.38s,"Give a summarize"
15m2.38s,15m5.38s,"That's a summary for you"
15m5.38s,15m7.38s,"It's very useful for the developer himself to send a PR"
15m7.38s,15m8.38s,"It's very useful for the reader"
15m8.38s,15m9.38s,"He can see this first"
15m9.38s,15m11.38s,"He can see this"
15m11.38s,15m12.38s,"The reader will know that"
15m12.38s,15m14.38s,"Hey, this is your whole code"
15m14.38s,15m15.38s,"What are you doing"
15m15.38s,15m17.38s,"And what may be produced"
15m17.38s,15m18.38s,"What problems are produced"
15m18.38s,15m19.38s,"And what suggestions do you give"
15m19.38s,15m21.38s,"Basically, I usually hope to say"
15m21.38s,15m23.38s,"Hey, he actually has some"
15m23.38s,15m24.38s,"Some ingressions"
15m24.38s,15m25.38s,"Then you didn't fix it"
15m25.38s,15m26.38s,"But wait for you to fix it"
15m26.38s,15m27.38s,"I'll go and see again"
15m27.38s,15m28.38s,"No problem"
15m28.38s,15m30.38s,"So basically I think the AI gives out"
15m30.38s,15m32.38s,"The suggestions are very, very useful"
15m32.38s,15m33.38s,"Not only in"
15m33.38s,15m35.38s,"Code language"
15m35.38s,15m36.38s,"In PHP, in any language"
15m36.38s,15m38.38s,"He sees a lot of it"
15m38.38s,15m40.38s,"Because he almost finished reading the Github code"
15m40.38s,15m42.38s,"That's 2021 data"
15m42.38s,15m43.38s,"Then I think that"
15m43.38s,15m46.38s,"The whole model base is already very, very powerful"
15m46.38s,15m48.38s,"So basically he can see that language"
15m48.38s,15m52.38s,"OK, this is the tool I'm going to introduce today"
15m52.38s,15m54.38s,"Then I think this is very useful"
15m54.38s,15m55.38s,"Then below is"
15m55.38s,15m58.38s,"OK, now is China and Hong Kong"
15m58.38s,16m0.38s,"Most companies have strict control over the whole"
16m0.38s,16m2.38s,"So this tool"
16m2.38s,16m4.38s,"Anyway, I developed it before"
16m4.38s,16m6.38s,"The process function can be linked to the socket"
16m6.38s,16m10.38s,"You can visit OpenAI through the process method"
16m10.38s,16m12.38s,"Or if you have a base UI"
16m12.38s,16m14.38s,"If you have your own Jaffa or Pross"
16m14.38s,16m15.38s,"It's also possible"
16m15.38s,16m16.38s,"OK, if you predict"
16m16.38s,16m19.38s,"I think the next step is the A9 OpenAI"
16m19.38s,16m20.38s,"When it comes in"
16m20.38s,16m22.38s,"It will support A9 OpenAI"
16m22.38s,16m25.38s,"Because the biggest shareholder of OpenAI is Microsoft"
16m25.38s,16m28.38s,"Microsoft also integrated this thing"
16m28.38s,16m31.38s,"Into their A9 Cloud service"
16m31.38s,16m33.38s,"So basically, in the future"
16m33.38s,16m36.38s,"Most companies will not be able to go with OpenAI"
16m36.38s,16m37.38s,"To do the connection"
16m37.38s,16m38.38s,"Because he has no ability to say"
16m38.38s,16m40.38s,"He won't take your data to do"
16m40.38s,16m42.38s,"Any training action"
16m42.38s,16m44.38s,"But Microsoft is on this side"
16m44.38s,16m45.38s,"Is able to say"
16m45.38s,16m48.38s,"We will never take your code"
16m48.38s,16m49.38s,"To do that training"
16m49.38s,16m51.38s,"This is to sign a follow-up contract with Microsoft"
16m51.38s,16m54.38s,"So this is the path that the big company is going to take"
16m54.38s,16m55.38s,"OK"
16m55.38s,16m59.38s,"I hope this tool will be helpful to you today"
16m59.38s,17m0.38s,"If you like"
17m0.38s,17m2.38s,"You can help me to like it"
17m2.38s,17m3.38s,"At present"
17m3.38s,17m5.38s,"I think there are quite a few people using it"
17m5.38s,17m7.38s,"So now there are about 300 people"
17m7.38s,17m8.38s,"If you like"
17m8.38s,17m9.38s,"Just help me introduce or promote"
17m9.38s,17m10.38s,"Thank you all"
17m10.38s,17m10.88s,"everyone"
