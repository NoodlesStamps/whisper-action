0s,2s,"Hello, everyone, I am Bui"
2s,5s,"This class can introduce a tool called"
5s,7s,"Use the TrueGPT Automation Developmental"
7s,9s,"Create a coming message"
9s,11s,"I will explain to you later"
11s,14s,"The first is why is the code GBT"
14s,17s,"Let's introduce the TrueGPT"
17s,18s,"How to use"
18s,20s,"Let's talk about the latest one"
20s,21s,"I use the new one"
21s,24s,"OK, everyone should not be unfamiliar with TrueGPT"
24s,28s,"Currently, it is AI, AIGC, AI Generator, Content"
28s,31s,"At present, when the red bomb is used"
31s,34s,"All the software development workers in the world are thinking about"
34s,38s,"How to use TrueGPT to help us develop the entire software"
38s,40s,"Or improve our"
40s,42s,"Use or environment"
42s,45s,"And I am here mainly to use TrueGPT to help you write"
45s,46s,"Kit Carman Manager"
46s,48s,"How to write the Kit Carman Manager"
48s,50s,"You can refer to this article"
50s,52s,"Then I will put it in the link below"
52s,54s,"OK, I am here"
54s,56s,"I directly use the source written in the CEL"
56s,57s,"The code GBT"
57s,1m0s,"If you like it, you can share it with me"
1m0s,1m2s,"The main point is to help the software"
1m2s,1m4s,"The software is to organize the development content"
1m4s,1m6s,"You can see the code GBT"
1m6s,1m8s,"The effect of creating Carman Manager"
1m8s,1m11s,"That is, you write the code you wrote today"
1m11s,1m13s,"You have to write to organize Carman Manager"
1m13s,1m15s,"For example, what does this function do"
1m15s,1m18s,"Or how to solve this bug"
1m18s,1m20s,"Then you may want to say how to"
1m20s,1m22s,"Write the content"
1m22s,1m24s,"Let everyone check it out later"
1m24s,1m25s,"Very good"
1m25s,1m27s,"Then we have no code GBT"
1m27s,1m29s,"I didn't use AI to help you to see the whole"
1m29s,1m30s,"Kit different content"
1m30s,1m33s,"After that, we help to automatically create these"
1m33s,1m35s,"You see this is the effect below"
1m35s,1m37s,"You see all of my cards here"
1m37s,1m40s,"All use this tool called code GBT"
1m40s,1m42s,"Help me produce it, but not me"
1m42s,1m45s,"That's basically what 8 or 9 are all right"
1m45s,1m47s,"That's basically what you want to do"
1m47s,1m49s,"Just go to do what you want"
1m49s,1m50s,"So basically if you are"
1m50s,1m52s,"It takes a long time to write the code"
1m52s,1m54s,"Then it's also"
1m54s,1m55s,"I hope you write it yourself"
1m55s,1m57s,"Carman Manager is helpful to the team"
1m57s,1m58s,"This tool can help you to"
1m58s,2m1s,"It takes a lot of time to improve"
2m1s,2m2s,"good"
2m2s,2m4s,"I don't want to write code GBT"
2m4s,2m6s,"In fact, the platform of Github has already"
2m6s,2m7s,"There are more similar tools like this"
2m7s,2m9s,"Why do you want to re-develop it"
2m9s,2m10s,"The first one is the cross-platform platform"
2m10s,2m18s,"I need to use the source of the cross-platform platform to avoid the different platforms and different environments"
2m18s,2m20s,"The second one is the future planning"
2m20s,2m23s,"The next Github, Github, Bbac and other Github platforms"
2m23s,2m25s,"After sending PR, you can use the chat"
2m25s,2m28s,"Gbt to help you to organize the content of Carman"
2m28s,2m30s,"And automatically leave a message"
2m30s,2m32s,"So this tool"
2m32s,2m33s,"So my development tool is not just"
2m33s,2m36s,"Let the developer be able to produce Carman Manager"
2m36s,2m37s,"I hope in the future"
2m37s,2m41s,"Can help the whole team to do the code review"
2m41s,2m43s,"The third reason is that in the future"
2m43s,2m46s,"I hope it's not just the open AI API"
2m46s,2m48s,"The Gbt API"
2m48s,2m50s,"Currently in the A9 API"
2m50s,2m51s,"Open AI has been supported"
2m51s,2m53s,"Okay, let's talk about how to use it"
2m53s,2m55s,"Actually, it's very simple"
2m55s,2m58s,"There will be a Linux Mac OS Windows every time"
2m58s,3m0s,"Download the corresponding execution file"
3m0s,3m2s,"You just need to download it and send it to BIN"
3m2s,3m5s,"Then go to the open AI website and create an API key"
3m5s,3m8s,"The first month seems to be free 18 USD"
3m8s,3m10s,"But I think this is already cheap"
3m10s,3m11s,"In fact, every day you just"
3m11s,3m15s,"No matter how much you have, it is now a true Gbt 3.5 Turbo version"
3m15s,3m16s,"It's actually very cheap"
3m16s,3m18s,"So basically you"
3m18s,3m20s,"The message of Carman"
3m20s,3m23s,"He saw the token number, actually not a dollar"
3m23s,3m25s,"Quite cheap, so everyone put it on the credit card"
3m25s,3m26s,"Because for you"
3m26s,3m29s,"It's very useful for your writing Carman Manager"
3m29s,3m31s,"And you don't have to waste time to organize your own"
3m31s,3m33s,"Write things"
3m33s,3m36s,"Okay, then everyone can actually use"
3m36s,3m38s,"Uh, Blue to install"
3m38s,3m39s,"We can take a look"
3m39s,3m41s,"Let's take a look at this website"
3m41s,3m45s,"Okay, it's easy"
3m45s,3m47s,"You can download from this list"
3m47s,3m49s,"To the corresponding execution file"
3m49s,4m1s,"You can download the"
4m1s,4m3s,"Use the blue install"
4m3s,4m5s,"That's basically blue tab"
4m5s,4m6s,"Apple Boy's tab"
4m6s,4m8s,"Then install"
4m8s,4m9s,"Then the next step is"
4m9s,4m11s,"The next step is how to use"
4m11s,4m13s,"Set up your API key"
4m13s,4m14s,"That's very simple"
4m14s,4m17s,"You can continue to use it after you create your API key"
4m17s,4m18s,"You just need to export this variable"
4m18s,4m21s,"After that, you will go to do the post-production thing"
4m21s,4m23s,"Okay, let's see how to use it in the bottom"
4m23s,4m25s,"Okay, let's take a look"
4m25s,4m28s,"Let's take a look at the current"
4m28s,4m29s,"Carmineo"
4m29s,4m30s,"Okay, because it's here"
4m30s,4m32s,"I changed one thing up here"
4m32s,4m35s,"Then let's take a look at the GIT leaf"
4m35s,4m37s,"Okay, look at me"
4m37s,4m38s,"After I changed this"
4m38s,4m40s,"Let's take a look at what it's going to do"
4m40s,4m42s,"Let's set it to"
4m42s,4m43s,"The third state"
4m43s,4m45s,"Okay, now we have code gbt"
4m45s,4m46s,"This Carmineo"
4m46s,4m48s,"You can play hlp"
4m48s,4m50s,"You can see that it has a lot of"
4m50s,4m51s,"Carme can use"
4m51s,4m52s,"The first Carmi"
4m52s,4m54s,"He'll help you to auto generate a Carmi Mesh"
4m54s,4m56s,"Then you can set your own Carmineo"
4m56s,4m58s,"Let me introduce this a little bit"
4m58s,5m1s,"Then you can also use the GIT hook method"
5m1s,5m3s,"Then this is less useful"
5m3s,5m5s,"If you need it, you can also use it"
5m5s,5m8s,"He will help you to set up a GIT hook"
5m8s,5m9s,"In your store"
5m9s,5m10s,"The store's GIT"
5m10s,5m13s,"Go to change your Carmi hook"
5m13s,5m15s,"Carmi hook is that you will automatically"
5m15s,5m17s,"Send the message to Carmi"
5m17s,5m19s,"Then there is one more important function"
5m19s,5m21s,"It can go to the Reunit"
5m21s,5m23s,"So this is what David will introduce"
5m23s,5m24s,"Let's take a look at it"
5m24s,5m26s,"Because we are now in a stage state"
5m26s,5m28s,"There is a CND"
5m28s,5m29s,"The structure is changed"
5m29s,5m31s,"We will open the content"
5m31s,5m35s,"Okay, in fact, it is to change"
5m35s,5m37s,"Change a constant"
5m37s,5m38s,"Change it to a"
5m38s,5m39s,"The address of your own address"
5m39s,5m41s,"Okay, then we only use the code gbt"
5m41s,5m42s,"Carmi"
5m42s,5m44s,"So he will automatically"
5m44s,5m46s,"Use the 3.5gbt turbo version"
5m46s,5m47s,"After that"
5m47s,5m48s,"Next, he will tell you"
5m48s,5m49s,"What is Carmi's summary"
5m49s,5m50s,"He will tell you"
5m50s,5m51s,"Up the environment"
5m51s,5m54s,"Marible Preface for Consistency"
5m54s,5m55s,"Then he will tell you"
5m55s,5m56s,"The content in it is"
5m56s,5m58s,"I changed the GitHub"
5m58s,5m59s,"Change the input"
5m59s,6m0s,"Change the weight to the bottom"
6m0s,6m1s,"The small write is heavy"
6m1s,6m3s,"Then after finishing it"
6m3s,6m4s,"Basically write it to you"
6m4s,6m5s,"Carmi message"
6m5s,6m6s,"You automatically Carmi"
6m6s,6m7s,"So you can see"
6m7s,6m9s,"You are automatically changed here"
6m9s,6m10s,"like this"
6m10s,6m11s,"good"
6m11s,6m12s,"good"
6m12s,6m14s,"If you are not satisfied with this message"
6m14s,6m16s,"You can use the same method"
6m16s,6m18s,"You can go down"
6m18s,6m19s,"This"
6m19s,6m20s,"That's it"
6m20s,6m22s,"It's the same as your GIT Carmi"
6m22s,6m24s,"You will change the Carmi message"
6m24s,6m25s,"Good"
6m25s,6m26s,"We will do it next"
6m26s,6m27s,"He must be the new"
6m27s,6m29s,"GPD 3.5 Turbo version"
6m29s,6m30s,"After that"
6m30s,6m32s,"He will go to change a new message"
6m32s,6m33s,"good"
6m33s,6m34s,"Until you change"
6m34s,6m35s,"What you want"
6m35s,6m36s,"The message you want"
6m36s,6m38s,"So you can keep changing"
6m38s,6m39s,"Of course"
6m39s,6m40s,"This is"
6m40s,6m42s,"Sign up to the token you calculated"
6m42s,6m43s,"So you see"
6m43s,6m44s,"Here I tell you"
6m44s,6m47s,"How much is your Pond token"
6m47s,6m49s,"Then how much is your comp"
6m49s,6m50s,"And then here"
6m50s,6m52s,"Total token is these two"
6m52s,6m53s,"That's your last"
6m53s,6m54s,"You may have to pay the maximum"
6m54s,6m55s,"Then the next one is"
6m55s,6m57s,"Each 1000 tokens is 0.002"
6m57s,6m58s,"That's very cheap"
6m58s,6m59s,"So basically you"
6m59s,7m0s,"No matter how much you use"
7m0s,7m1s,"Almost not much"
7m1s,7m2s,"More than a dollar"
7m2s,7m4s,"So you can save"
7m4s,7m5s,"The money you save every day"
7m5s,7m6s,"To order a cup of drinks"
7m6s,7m7s,"In fact, you can save a day"
7m7s,7m8s,"How much you save"
7m8s,7m9s,"Carmi message"
7m9s,7m11s,"So I think it's basically"
7m11s,7m12s,"Pretty convenient"
7m12s,7m13s,"Then the other"
7m13s,7m15s,"Let's take a look at the website"
7m15s,7m16s,"How to use"
7m16s,7m17s,"good"
7m17s,7m19s,"In fact, we can go through a"
7m19s,7m20s,"Code GPD"
7m20s,7m21s,"Go to use the comp"
7m21s,7m22s,"This is the point of the chain"
7m22s,7m24s,"To set up some environment"
7m24s,7m25s,"For example"
7m25s,7m26s,"Okay, I wrote down the opa"
7m26s,7m28s,"After writing it in"
7m28s,7m30s,"Basically, I don't have to go to the eSport anymore"
7m30s,7m31s,"Because it will directly"
7m31s,7m33s,"The store under the roof"
7m33s,7m35s,"Code GPD store"
7m35s,7m36s,"Code GPD store"
7m36s,7m38s,"Go to write in these settings"
7m38s,7m39s,"Then it's automatic"
7m39s,7m41s,"So basically you don't have to go to the sign up"
7m41s,7m42s,"Then what about"
7m42s,7m43s,"OpenAI"
7m43s,7m44s,"OpenAI has a window"
7m44s,7m45s,"Base"
7m45s,7m47s,"This is the reason why this window"
7m47s,7m48s,"The reason is that"
7m48s,7m49s,"You see all the companies now"
7m49s,7m51s,"Almost all the companies in the network"
7m51s,7m53s,"OpenAI's network is blocked"
7m53s,7m54s,"After that"
7m54s,7m55s,"Everyone is crazy"
7m55s,7m56s,"The fake"
7m56s,7m57s,"Forward proxy"
7m57s,7m58s,"Then you can change the forward proxy"
7m58s,7m59s,"You can change this point"
7m59s,8m0s,"The best UI"
8m0s,8m2s,"Then I guess at the beginning"
8m2s,8m3s,"OpenAI should have"
8m3s,8m4s,"Found this problem"
8m4s,8m6s,"Just when the file is out"
8m6s,8m8s,"He told me that he can"
8m8s,8m10s,"Everyone's best UI can be changed"
8m10s,8m11s,"So you can change it"
8m11s,8m12s,"What you want"
8m12s,8m14s,"Then everyone can use this free"
8m14s,8m16s,"Many people say that"
8m16s,8m18s,"What if my key is stolen"
8m18s,8m20s,"If I don't believe it, I'll just go and fake it myself"
8m20s,8m22s,"Then this is a Chinese developer"
8m22s,8m23s,"The price"
8m23s,8m25s,"Then he is a Dino developer"
8m25s,8m26s,"Ok"
8m26s,8m28s,"Then you can put some"
8m28s,8m29s,"Some data"
8m29s,8m30s,"Write down"
8m30s,8m31s,"API key"
8m31s,8m32s,"And your organization"
8m32s,8m33s,"Just assume that your account"
8m33s,8m35s,"There are more organizations"
8m35s,8m36s,"Remember to set this"
8m36s,8m37s,"Ok"
8m37s,8m39s,"Then you can use the model you want to use"
8m39s,8m41s,"Then you can use GPD 3.5 now"
8m41s,8m42s,"Turbo"
8m42s,8m44s,"Or you need a larger token"
8m44s,8m45s,"Because GPD 3.5"
8m45s,8m47s,"His token is the token of 409"
8m47s,8m49s,"Then you can go to GPD 4"
8m49s,8m51s,"Maybe you can use 8K token"
8m51s,8m53s,"Or 32K token"
8m53s,8m55s,"But his cost is"
8m55s,8m56s,"One is 15 times"
8m56s,8m57s,"One is 30 times"
8m57s,8m58s,"So everyone, be careful to use it"
8m58s,8m59s,"If you need it"
8m59s,9m0s,"But basically"
9m0s,9m1s,"If you just want to do"
9m1s,9m2s,"The card version"
9m2s,9m3s,"If you use GPD 3.5"
9m3s,9m5s,"The terminal is very, very useful"
9m5s,9m7s,"Then in terms of language"
9m7s,9m8s,"You basically use it now"
9m8s,9m9s,"English"
9m9s,9m11s,"You can change your card version"
9m11s,9m12s,"Chinese"
9m12s,9m13s,"Chinese"
9m13s,9m14s,"Chinese"
9m14s,9m15s,"Chinese"
9m15s,9m16.56s,"You can put it here"
9m16.56s,9m19.62s,"And then I have one more"
9m19.62s,9m21.6s,"Plask function or Sakir!"
9m21.6s,9m25.8s,"It's a link, so you're doing these Sakir and Plask"
9m25.8s,9m29.58s,"You can vote for this way to link this OpenAI UI"
9m29.58s,9m31s,"and then it's timeout"
9m31s,9m32.44s,"This timeout is to pretend that your"
9m32.44s,9m35.42s,"Your token needs to look very much"
9m35.42s,9m39.28s,"Sometimes OpenAI will be noisy because there is too much of OpenAI"
9m39.28s,9m41.02s,"So sometimes it will be very slow"
9m41.02s,9m43.5s,"So you just turn this type of high"
9m43.5s,9m45.24s,"Then there is Miss Token"
9m45.24s,9m46.32s,"This token is that"
9m46.32s,9m47.96s,"When you reply"
9m47.96s,9m49.32s,"These words are too sour"
9m49.32s,9m51.64s,"Is it in this compression token?"
9m51.64s,9m55.56s,"If you don't use this token, you can increase it from here"
9m55.56s,9m56.92s,"The default is 300"
9m56.92s,9m58.6s,"But the main reason for adjusting this is"
9m58.6s,10m1.48s,"Because you need this when you are doing code reviews"
10m1.48s,10m2.16s,"good"
10m2.16s,10m5.08s,"Then there is Temperature"
10m5.08s,10m8.12s,"This is the basic OpenAI parameters"
10m8.12s,10m9.3s,"0.7"
10m9.3s,10m12.2s,"0.0 to 0.2"
10m12.2s,10m14.46s,"Then the higher the answer, the higher the answer"
10m14.46s,10m15.98s,"So don't be too high or too low"
10m15.98s,10m19.38s,"So 0.7 should be the parameters of this network"
10m19.38s,10m20.74s,"There is another called"
10m20.74s,10m21.74s,"Diff Unify"
10m21.74s,10m22.46s,"This thing"
10m22.46s,10m23.86s,"I'll cut this"
10m23.86s,10m25.26s,"You can look at it"
10m25.26s,10m26.92s,"Sometimes I put this"
10m26.92s,10m28.02s,"Ok, this is good"
10m28.02s,10m30.62s,"You will see that my Diff Nino has"
10m30.62s,10m33.62s,"The front and the back are all leaked"
10m33.62s,10m35.94s,"This is the thing that Git predicted"
10m35.94s,10m37.42s,"But your Diff Nino"
10m37.42s,10m39.38s,"So it's like this in the Diff"
10m39.38s,10m41.36s,"If your Git Diff"
10m41.36s,10m43.36s,"If you set this Unify to 0"
10m43.36s,10m44.36s,"Basically"
10m44.36s,10m47.64s,"It will only leak this red and green"
10m47.64s,10m48.92s,"Can we try it"
10m48.92s,10m53.6s,"Ok, basically it has a"
10m53.6s,10m56.16s,"There is a Diff thing"
10m56.16s,10m57.16s,"Anyway, this is"
10m57.16s,10m59.56s,"This is basically the adjustment"
10m59.56s,11m0.8s,"Can you think about it?"
11m0.8s,11m1.44s,"He adjusts it"
11m1.44s,11m3.84s,"Do I want to see the front row"
11m3.84s,11m5.04s,"And the back row"
11m5.04s,11m6.4s,"The prediction is 3 rows"
11m6.4s,11m7.96s,"So basically you adjust it"
11m7.96s,11m9.42s,"We send it to token"
11m9.42s,11m10.74s,"We send it to OpenAI"
11m10.74s,11m12.54s,"You can reduce the token amount"
11m12.54s,11m14.54s,"So this is also the benefit of reducing the token amount"
11m14.54s,11m15.58s,"So if your"
11m15.58s,11m17.74s,"Your Diff Nino is very long"
11m17.74s,11m18.94s,"Basically you can adjust it a little bit"
11m18.94s,11m20.82s,"It will save some tokens"
11m20.82s,11m22.74s,"Then basically I think you can set it to 0"
11m22.74s,11m23.58s,"Because"
11m23.58s,11m25.3s,"Basically"
11m25.3s,11m28.5s,"OpenAI is looking at the front and the back"
11m28.5s,11m30.86s,"The whole answer is not very big"
11m30.86s,11m32.3s,"So basically I set it to 0"
11m32.3s,11m33.9s,"Ok"
11m33.9s,11m35.3s,"Then there is Isqulis"
11m35.3s,11m37.58s,"Ok, I think this is very useful"
11m37.58s,11m39.3s,"Then what does this thing do"
11m39.3s,11m40.3s,"Suppose you change things"
11m40.3s,11m42.02s,"For example, that kind of package"
11m42.02s,11m42.9s,"Point decision"
11m42.9s,11m44.22s,"Or package"
11m44.22s,11m45.02s,"That is"
11m45.02s,11m45.86s,"NPN"
11m45.86s,11m46.66s,"NPN"
11m46.66s,11m47.66s,"Confirmation of the decision"
11m47.66s,11m48.74s,"That actually has no use"
11m48.74s,11m50.18s,"Or the structure inside"
11m50.18s,11m51.02s,"For example, this structure"
11m51.02s,11m52.14s,"The point of the structure"
11m52.14s,11m53.78s,"This thing is actually no use"
11m53.78s,11m54.82s,"Then send it to"
11m54.82s,11m56.98s,"OpenAI and set the token amount"
11m56.98s,11m58.9s,"So basically I will choose this"
11m58.9s,12m1.26s,"So if it's similar, it's like this"
12m1.26s,12m3.74s,"Ok"
12m3.74s,12m5.22s,"For example, like this"
12m5.22s,12m6.9s,"I set it to 0"
12m6.9s,12m7.86s,"Defunify"
12m7.86s,12m9.14s,"Then Isqulis"
12m9.14s,12m9.62s,"I set it"
12m9.62s,12m10.94s,"For example, you have Taste of Fire"
12m10.94s,12m14.06s,"That basically doesn't mean anything"
12m14.06s,12m15.5s,"We don't want to give OpenAI"
12m15.5s,12m17.14s,"We don't want to give AI to look"
12m17.14s,12m18.66s,"But it's in this card"
12m18.66s,12m19.5s,"In the card"
12m19.5s,12m21.06s,"We just drop it"
12m21.06s,12m23.02s,"Basically this is the parameters"
12m23.02s,12m24.62s,"So this is what we just talked about"
12m24.62s,12m26.18s,"It's that it can do"
12m26.18s,12m27.62s,"The preview of the card"
12m27.62s,12m29.58s,"You can also download the preview"
12m29.58s,12m31.46s,"The first thing is that I don't"
12m31.46s,12m32.38s,"Do this"
12m32.38s,12m34.1s,"Do the card on the card"
12m34.1s,12m35.14s,"Help you do the card"
12m35.14s,12m36.86s,"Then you basically have Stained Fire"
12m36.86s,12m37.82s,"Still here"
12m37.82s,12m39.98s,"Then this is the translation of the script"
12m39.98s,12m41.94s,"Then basically don't use this function"
12m41.94s,12m44.14s,"Don't translate it into Chinese"
12m44.14s,12m46.58s,"Because the token amount of Chinese is quite large"
12m46.58s,12m48.34s,"So everyone please use it carefully"
12m48.34s,12m49.98s,"Then this is"
12m49.98s,12m50.9s,"Just demoed"
12m50.9s,12m53.26s,"If you are not satisfied with the first card content"
12m53.26s,12m54.66s,"Of the message"
12m54.66s,12m55.42s,"If you are not satisfied"
12m55.42s,12m57.26s,"You can keep downloading this command"
12m57.26s,12m59.74s,"You can continue to modify the last card"
12m59.74s,13m1.5s,"Then there was a user before"
13m1.5s,13m2.5s,"Tell me"
13m2.5s,13m4.82s,"This card content is a little bit different"
13m4.82s,13m5.9s,"No problem"
13m5.9s,13m7.46s,"You can define this template"
13m7.46s,13m8.98s,"Then there are a few parameters"
13m8.98s,13m10.18s,"Summary of Preface"
13m10.18s,13m11.22s,"Summary of Title"
13m11.22s,13m12.26s,"Summary of Message"
13m12.26s,13m12.9s,"You can use it"
13m12.9s,13m13.98s,"So you can download a"
13m13.98s,13m14.9s,"Template Stream"
13m14.9s,13m16.3s,"To change these things"
13m16.3s,13m17.46s,"Or Template Fire"
13m17.46s,13m19.3s,"You can set it up"
13m19.3s,13m20.7s,"OK, the script is not here"
13m20.7s,13m21.7s,"It's very simple"
13m21.7s,13m22.74s,"Install"
13m22.74s,13m23.66s,"And Uninstall"
13m23.66s,13m24.42s,"Then you say"
13m24.42s,13m25.38s,"GetAdder"
13m25.38s,13m26.3s,"These fire"
13m26.3s,13m27.38s,"In the next Git card"
13m27.38s,13m28.98s,"It will jump out of a window"
13m28.98s,13m30.06s,"Is the window in the card"
13m30.06s,13m32.18s,"Then download the AI-shaped card"
13m32.18s,13m33.94s,"Water to you"
13m33.94s,13m35.54s,"So you see it's going to generate"
13m35.54s,13m36.66s,"It's going to help you do the card"
13m36.66s,13m38.34s,"So it's very simple"
13m38.34s,13m40.34s,"Then finally let's talk about a call review"
13m40.34s,13m41.3s,"That call review is easy"
13m41.3s,13m42.62s,"It's the same as the Git card review"
13m42.62s,13m44.34s,"Just say it doesn't help you do the card"
13m44.34s,13m46.06s,"It helps you do the call review"
13m46.06s,13m47.3s,"That's what it means"
13m47.3s,13m48.78s,"OK, let's do the same"
13m48.78s,13m50.58s,"Let's take a look at an example"
13m50.58s,13m52.34s,"Suppose we let's take a look at this code"
13m52.34s,13m53.34s,"OK"
13m53.34s,13m55.62s,"Let's go to the PHP file"
13m55.62s,13m56.34s,"OK"
13m56.34s,13m59.38s,".php"
13m59.38s,14m0.38s,"OK"
14m0.38s,14m1.38s,"The same"
14m1.38s,14m2.66s,"Let's put the script on"
14m2.66s,14m4.66s,"OK, let's take a look at this"
14m4.66s,14m5.66s,"This"
14m5.66s,14m7.66s,"How to use"
14m7.66s,14m9.66s,".php"
14m9.66s,14m10.66s,"CodeGPD"
14m10.66s,14m11.66s,"OK"
14m11.66s,14m12.66s,"We are"
14m12.66s,14m13.66s,"Anyway, just use"
14m13.66s,14m14.66s,"Review"
14m14.66s,14m15.66s,"We will next review"
14m15.66s,14m16.66s,"OK"
14m16.66s,14m18.66s,"Next review is the same"
14m18.66s,14m20.66s,"He will go to see the content in this stage file"
14m20.66s,14m22.66s,"Then he starts to do"
14m22.66s,14m23.66s,"ReviewCodeChange"
14m23.66s,14m24.66s,"Then this"
14m24.66s,14m26.66s,"He needs to spend a period of time"
14m26.66s,14m28.66s,"Then you can spray these"
14m28.66s,14m29.66s,"These information"
14m29.66s,14m31.66s,"In fact, this thing is actually very useful"
14m31.66s,14m34.66s,"In the beginning, he told you that he may have some"
14m34.66s,14m36.66s,"Some ingestion"
14m36.66s,14m37.66s,"So you have to"
14m37.66s,14m39.66s,"Go to verify the input"
14m39.66s,14m40.66s,"What are you doing"
14m40.66s,14m41.66s,"Enter the user card"
14m41.66s,14m42.66s,"So I think these"
14m42.66s,14m43.66s,"The tools are very useful"
14m43.66s,14m45.66s,"He made 5 points for you"
14m45.66s,14m46.66s,"He made 5 points for you"
14m46.66s,14m47.66s,"So basically"
14m47.66s,14m49.66s,"I hope this thing can continue our"
14m49.66s,14m50.66s,"RuntyCoverFloor"
14m50.66s,14m52.66s,"Every time the user posts pr"
14m52.66s,14m54.66s,"For example, your team"
14m54.66s,14m55.66s,"The team is posting pr"
14m55.66s,14m56.66s,"I automatically"
14m56.66s,14m57.66s,"From your"
14m57.66s,14m58.66s,"From your this card"
14m58.66s,14m59.66s,"All of the content"
14m59.66s,15m0.66s,"Go to the code review"
15m0.66s,15m1.66s,"Give a summarized"
15m1.66s,15m2.66s,"That summarized"
15m2.66s,15m3.66s,"For you"
15m3.66s,15m4.66s,"Very useful"
15m4.66s,15m5.66s,"For the developer"
15m5.66s,15m7.66s,"It is very useful to the developer"
15m7.66s,15m8.66s,"Then for the reviewer"
15m8.66s,15m9.66s,"He can look at this first"
15m9.66s,15m11.66s,"He can look at this review"
15m11.66s,15m12.66s,"Summoned"
15m12.66s,15m13.66s,"You know that you"
15m13.66s,15m14.66s,"What are you doing with this whole code"
15m14.66s,15m15.66s,"And maybe"
15m15.66s,15m17.66s,"What are the problems"
15m17.66s,15m18.66s,"What are the problems"
15m18.66s,15m19.66s,"And what suggestions"
15m19.66s,15m20.66s,"Basically"
15m20.66s,15m21.66s,"Usually need to say"
15m21.66s,15m23.66s,"He actually has some"
15m23.66s,15m24.66s,"Some ingestion"
15m24.66s,15m25.66s,"That's not you"
15m25.66s,15m26.66s,"But wait for you to fix it"
15m26.66s,15m27.66s,"I'll go and see"
15m27.66s,15m28.66s,"No problem"
15m28.66s,15m29.66s,"So basically"
15m29.66s,15m30.66s,"I think the suggestions"
15m30.66s,15m32.66s,"The suggestions are very, very good"
15m32.66s,15m33.66s,"Not just in"
15m33.66s,15m38.66s,"Code"
15m38.66s,15m39.66s,"Because he almost"
15m39.66s,15m40.66s,"I've finished watching the game"
15m40.66s,15m42.66s,"That's the 2021 data"
15m42.66s,15m43.66s,"I think that"
15m43.66s,15m44.66s,"The whole model base"
15m44.66s,15m46.66s,"Has been very, very strong"
15m46.66s,15m47.66s,"So basically"
15m47.66s,15m48.66s,"He can look at the language"
15m48.66s,15m49.66s,"good"
15m49.66s,15m52.66s,"That's what I'm going to introduce today"
15m52.66s,15m54.66s,"Then I think it's very useful"
15m54.66s,15m55.66s,"That's below"
15m55.66s,15m56.66s,"good"
15m56.66s,15m57.66s,"That's China and Hong Kong"
15m57.66s,15m58.66s,"In fact, most companies"
15m58.66s,16m0.66s,"Are strict with the CFC"
16m0.66s,16m1.66s,"So this tool"
16m1.66s,16m2.66s,"I've just developed"
16m2.66s,16m4.66s,"Processing function"
16m4.66s,16m6.66s,"You can connect with the Sacky"
16m6.66s,16m7.66s,"You can use the process"
16m7.66s,16m9.66s,"Or visit OpenAI"
16m9.66s,16m11.66s,"Or if you have"
16m11.66s,16m12.66s,"If you have a base UI"
16m12.66s,16m13.66s,"You have a Java or a proxy"
16m13.66s,16m14.66s,"It's okay"
16m14.66s,16m15.66s,"Well, if you expect"
16m15.66s,16m16.66s,"I think the next step"
16m16.66s,16m18.66s,"Is the OpenAI"
16m18.66s,16m19.66s,"OpenAI"
16m19.66s,16m20.66s,"After coming in"
16m20.66s,16m21.66s,"He will also support"
16m21.66s,16m22.66s,"OpenAI"
16m22.66s,16m23.66s,"Because OpenAI"
16m23.66s,16m25.66s,"The biggest share is software"
16m25.66s,16m27.66s,"Then Microsoft also"
16m27.66s,16m28.66s,"This thing is integrated"
16m28.66s,16m29.66s,"Into their"
16m29.66s,16m31.66s,"The entire cloud service of Agile"
16m31.66s,16m32.66s,"So basically"
16m32.66s,16m33.66s,"In terms of"
16m33.66s,16m34.66s,"Most of the companies"
16m34.66s,16m35.66s,"It's impossible to"
16m35.66s,16m36.66s,"Go to OpenAI"
16m36.66s,16m38.66s,"Because he didn't have the ability"
16m38.66s,16m39.66s,"He won't take your data"
16m39.66s,16m40.66s,"Do any"
16m40.66s,16m41.66s,"The training tool"
16m41.66s,16m42.66s,"But Microsoft"
16m42.66s,16m43.66s,"He is"
16m43.66s,16m44.66s,"This is a possibility"
16m44.66s,16m45.66s,"I heard"
16m45.66s,16m46.66s,"We will never"
16m46.66s,16m47.66s,"Go to the code"
16m47.66s,16m48.66s,"Do that"
16m48.66s,16m49.66s,"The right thing"
16m49.66s,16m50.66s,"This is to sign with Microsoft"
16m50.66s,16m51.66s,"The contract later"
16m51.66s,16m52.66s,"So this is the"
16m52.66s,16m54.66s,"The big company is going to go"
16m54.66s,16m55.66s,"Ok"
16m55.66s,16m56.66s,"I hope"
16m56.66s,16m58.66s,"I hope to introduce this tool today"
16m58.66s,16m59.66s,"Is helpful to everyone"
16m59.66s,17m0.66s,"If you like it"
17m0.66s,17m2.66s,"You can help me to click on the heart"
17m2.66s,17m3.66s,"Click on the war"
17m3.66s,17m4.66s,"At present, I think it's"
17m4.66s,17m5.66s,"A lot of people are using it"
17m5.66s,17m6.66s,"So now it's about 300"
17m6.66s,17m7.66s,"More people are standing"
17m7.66s,17m8.66s,"If you like it"
17m8.66s,17m10.66s,"Just help me introduce the propaganda"
