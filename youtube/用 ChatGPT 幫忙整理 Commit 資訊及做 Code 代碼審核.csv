0s,2s,"Hello, everyone, I am Buyi."
2s,5s,"This class will introduce a tool called"
5s,7s,"Use the TrueGPT Automation Developer"
7s,9s,"Create a coming message"
9s,12s,"I will explain the three important things later."
12s,14s,"The first is why the code is called "GPT""
14s,17s,"Let's introduce the TrueGPT"
17s,18s,"How to use it"
18s,20s,"Let's talk about the latest one."
20s,21s,"I use the new one."
21s,24s,"OK, everyone should not be unfamiliar with TrueGPT"
24s,28s,"Currently, it is AI, AIGC, AI Generator, Content"
28s,31s,"At present, when it comes to red-grinding machine"
31s,34s,"All the software development workers in the world are thinking about"
34s,38s,"How to use TrueGPT to help us develop the entire software process"
38s,41s,"Or improve our environment"
41s,43s,"And I am most important here"
43s,46s,"Use TrueGPT to write the KitKartMessage"
46s,48s,"How to write the KitKartMessage"
48s,50s,"You can refer to this article"
50s,52s,"I will put it in the link below"
52s,55s,"I directly use the source"
55s,57s,"The source is called CodeGPT"
57s,1m0s,"If you like it, you can share it with me"
1m0s,1m4s,"The main point is to help the software development"
1m4s,1m8s,"You can see CodeGPT creates the KitKartMessage effect"
1m8s,1m11s,"You write the code first"
1m11s,1m13s,"You have to write the KitKartMessage"
1m13s,1m15s,"For example, what does this function do"
1m15s,1m18s,"Or how do I solve this bug"
1m18s,1m22s,"You may want to say how to write the content"
1m22s,1m25s,"Let everyone know when they check"
1m25s,1m27s,"After we have CodeGPT"
1m27s,1m30s,"We use AI to help you see the whole KitKartMessage"
1m30s,1m33s,"We help to automatically create this content"
1m33s,1m35s,"You see this is the bottom effect"
1m35s,1m38s,"You see all the KartMessage here"
1m38s,1m40s,"All use this tool called CodeGPT"
1m40s,1m41s,"Help me create"
1m41s,1m42s,"Not me"
1m42s,1m45s,"Basically, 8 or 9% is correct"
1m45s,1m47s,"Basically, if you want to slightly tweak yourself"
1m47s,1m49s,"You can do the effect you want"
1m49s,1m52s,"Basically, if you have a long time to enter the code"
1m52s,1m55s,"That's also because I hope that the KartMessage you write"
1m55s,1m57s,"Is helpful to the team"
1m57s,2m1s,"This tool can help you to reduce a lot of time"
2m1s,2m3s,"Ok, then"
2m3s,2m5s,"I don't want to write CodeGPT"
2m5s,2m7s,"In fact, the KitKart platform has already"
2m7s,2m8s,"Similar tools like this"
2m8s,2m9s,"Why do you want to re-develop it"
2m9s,2m10s,"The first one is the cross-platform platform"
2m10s,2m12s,"I need to use the source"
2m12s,2m15s,"To avoid the different platforms and different environments"
2m15s,2m18s,"This is easier for developers who do not receive the environment"
2m18s,2m20s,"The second one is that my future plan is"
2m20s,2m23s,"The next GitHub, GitHub, Bbac and other platforms"
2m23s,2m26s,"After sending PR, you can automatically help"
2m26s,2m28s,"Help to organize the content of KartMessage"
2m28s,2m30s,"And automatically leave a message"
2m30s,2m32s,"Then this tool"
2m32s,2m34s,"So my development tool is not just a single developer"
2m34s,2m36s,"Can automatically create KartMessage"
2m36s,2m38s,"In the future, I hope that the whole"
2m38s,2m41s,"Can be motivated to help to do the code"
2m41s,2m43s,"Then the third reason is that in the future"
2m43s,2m46s,"I hope it's not just an open AI API"
2m46s,2m48s,"The current API of TrueGPT"
2m48s,2m50s,"Currently in Azure's API"
2m50s,2m52s,"Open AI has been supported"
2m52s,2m54s,"Next, let's talk about how to use it"
2m54s,2m55s,"Actually, it's very simple"
2m55s,2m57s,"Every time, the number of users will have"
2m57s,3m0s,"The corresponding self-sufficiency file of Linux, Mac OS Windows"
3m0s,3m2s,"You just need to send it to BIN"
3m2s,3m4s,"Then go to OpenAI's website"
3m4s,3m6s,"Create an API key"
3m6s,3m8s,"Every month seems to be free 18 dollars"
3m8s,3m10s,"But I think this is already cheap"
3m10s,3m12s,"In fact, every day, you know"
3m12s,3m14s,"No matter how much you have, it is TrueGPT"
3m14s,3m16s,"3.5 Turbo version"
3m16s,3m18s,"It's actually very cheap"
3m18s,3m20s,"So basically, you look at KartMessage"
3m20s,3m22s,"He saw the token number"
3m22s,3m24s,"Actually not even a dollar"
3m24s,3m26s,"It's quite cheap, so everyone put the credit card on it"
3m26s,3m28s,"Because it's very useful for your"
3m28s,3m30s,"Write KartMessage"
3m30s,3m32s,"And you don't have to waste time to organize"
3m32s,3m34s,"The things you wrote"
3m34s,3m36s,"After everyone has finished"
3m36s,3m38s,"You can use the blog to install"
3m38s,3m40s,"We can take a look"
3m40s,3m42s,"Let's take a look at this website"
3m42s,3m44s,"Ok, it's very simple"
3m44s,3m46s,"You can download from this list"
3m46s,3m48s,"To the corresponding self-sufficiency file"
3m48s,3m50s,"You can download"
3m50s,3m52s,"The answer for your answer"
3m52s,3m54s,"64 and Andy 64 or Linux version"
3m54s,3m56s,"Or Windows version can be"
3m56s,3m58s,"Or you can use Mac"
3m58s,4m0s,"Very simple"
4m0s,4m2s,"You can use Blue install"
4m2s,4m4s,"Basically, it's blue tab"
4m4s,4m6s,"Apple Boy's Latch tab"
4m6s,4m8s,"Then install"
4m8s,4m10s,"Then the next step is"
4m10s,4m12s,"How to use"
4m12s,4m14s,"Set up your API key"
4m14s,4m16s,"It's very simple, you can use it after you create your API key"
4m16s,4m18s,"You just need to export this variable"
4m18s,4m20s,"I'll do the post-sale thing next"
4m20s,4m22s,"Let's see how to use it at the bottom"
4m22s,4m24s,"Let's take a look"
4m24s,4m26s,"Let's take a look at the current"
4m26s,4m28s,"Karmineo"
4m28s,4m30s,"Ok, because it's here"
4m30s,4m32s,"I changed one thing"
4m32s,4m34s,"Let's take a look at"
4m34s,4m36s,"GITLIF"
4m36s,4m38s,"Ok, look, I changed this"
4m38s,4m40s,"After we change it, let's see how it"
4m40s,4m42s,"How to do it"
4m42s,4m44s,"Let's set it to 3"
4m44s,4m46s,"Ok, now we have a code GBT"
4m46s,4m48s,"This Karmineo"
4m48s,4m50s,"You can play hlp"
4m50s,4m52s,"You can see that it has many Karmineo"
4m52s,4m54s,"The first Karmineo"
4m54s,4m56s,"It will help you to auto-jump the Karmineo"
4m56s,4m58s,"Then you can set your own Karmineo"
4m58s,5m0s,"Let me introduce this a little bit"
5m0s,5m2s,"Then you can also use the GITHOOG method"
5m2s,5m4s,"This is less used"
5m4s,5m6s,"If you need it, you can use it"
5m6s,5m8s,"It will help you to set a GITHOOG"
5m8s,5m10s,"Under your point"
5m10s,5m12s,"Under the point key"
5m12s,5m14s,"To change your Karmineo"
5m14s,5m16s,"Then you can auto-jump the Karmineo"
5m16s,5m18s,"When you use Karmineo"
5m18s,5m20s,"Then there is a most important function"
5m20s,5m22s,"It can go to the remote control"
5m22s,5m24s,"So I will introduce it later"
5m24s,5m26s,"Let's take a look at it"
5m26s,5m28s,"We are now in a stage state"
5m28s,5m30s,"There is a CND.go"
5m30s,5m32s,"Let's take a look at the content"
5m32s,5m34s,"Ok, in fact,"
5m34s,5m36s,"Change the variable of a console"
5m36s,5m38s,"Change the variable of a console"
5m38s,5m40s,"Change the variable of a console"
5m40s,5m42s,"Ok, let's use the code "gbt""
5m42s,5m44s,"Karmineo"
5m44s,5m46s,"Then it will automatically use the 3.5 GBT"
5m46s,5m48s,"After the turbo version"
5m48s,5m50s,"Then it will tell you what is Karmineo"
5m50s,5m52s,"It will tell you the "up the environment""
5m52s,5m54s,""Marable""
5m54s,5m56s,"Then it will tell you"
5m56s,5m58s,"The content inside it is"
5m58s,6m0s,"I changed the Github to input"
6m0s,6m2s,"I changed the weight to the bottom"
6m2s,6m4s,"After changing it, it basically writes to you"
6m4s,6m6s,"Karmineo"
6m6s,6m8s,"So you can see"
6m8s,6m10s,"It's automatically changed to this way"
6m10s,6m14s,"Ok, if you are not satisfied with this message"
6m14s,6m16s,"You can use the other way"
6m16s,6m18s,"You can download this"
6m18s,6m20s,"Then this is actually"
6m20s,6m22s,"The same as your Github Karmineo"
6m22s,6m24s,"You will go to change the Karmineo"
6m24s,6m26s,"Ok, we will do it next"
6m26s,6m28s,"It must be the 3.5 GBT turbo version"
6m28s,6m30s,"After that, it will"
6m30s,6m32s,"Change a new message"
6m32s,6m34s,"Ok, until you change"
6m34s,6m36s,"The message you want"
6m36s,6m38s,"So you can keep changing"
6m38s,6m40s,"Of course"
6m40s,6m41s,"It's all up to your"
6m41s,6m43s,"The token amount"
6m43s,6m45s,"So you see here, I tell you"
6m45s,6m47s,"How much is your Pond token"
6m47s,6m49s,"Then how much is your Karmineo token"
6m49s,6m51s,"Then the total token here is these two"
6m51s,6m53s,"Then it's your last"
6m53s,6m55s,"You may have to pay the price"
6m55s,6m57s,"Now every 1000 tokens is 0.002 USD"
6m57s,6m58s,"That's very cheap"
6m58s,7m0s,"So basically you don't care how much you use every day"
7m0s,7m2s,"Almost not much"
7m2s,7m4s,"So you can save"
7m4s,7m6s,"Go to save every day to pay the drinks"
7m6s,7m8s,"In fact, you can save a day"
7m8s,7m10s,"How much is your Karmineo"
7m10s,7m12s,"So I think it's basically"
7m12s,7m14s,"That other"
7m14s,7m16s,"Let's take a look at the Internet"
7m16s,7m18s,"Ok, then in fact"
7m18s,7m20s,"We can go through a code"
7m20s,7m22s,"Use Karmineo to"
7m22s,7m24s,"Set some environment data"
7m24s,7m26s,"For example, I wrote down the OPAPL"
7m26s,7m28s,"After writing it down"
7m28s,7m30s,"Basically, I don't have to go to the eSports anymore"
7m30s,7m31s,"Because it will directly"
7m31s,7m33s,"Under the screen"
7m33s,7m35s,"CodeGPT"
7m35s,7m36s,"CodeGPT.yaml"
7m36s,7m38s,"Go to write in these settings"
7m38s,7m39s,"Then it's automatic"
7m39s,7m41s,"So basically you don't have to worry about it"
7m41s,7m43s,"Then openAI"
7m43s,7m44s,"OpenAI has a function"
7m44s,7m45s,"Base"
7m45s,7m46s,"The line is here"
7m46s,7m48s,"Why is this function"
7m48s,7m50s,"You see now all companies"
7m50s,7m51s,"Almost all of this"
7m51s,7m53s,"OpenAI's king is all blocked"
7m53s,7m55s,"After that, everyone is crazy"
7m55s,7m57s,"For the policy"
7m57s,7m58s,"For the policy"
7m58s,7m59s,"You can change this point"
7m59s,8m1s,"Base UI"
8m1s,8m2s,"I guess at the beginning"
8m2s,8m3s,"OpenAI should have"
8m3s,8m4s,"Found this problem"
8m4s,8m6s,"When the recording is out"
8m6s,8m8s,"He told me that he can"
8m8s,8m10s,"Everyone can change the base UI"
8m10s,8m12s,"So you can change it into what you want"
8m12s,8m14s,"Everyone can use this free"
8m14s,8m16s,"Many people think that"
8m16s,8m17s,"My key is stolen"
8m17s,8m18s,"What are you doing"
8m18s,8m20s,"If I don't believe it, I'll go to the store myself"
8m20s,8m22s,"This is a Chinese developer"
8m22s,8m24s,"Developers"
8m24s,8m26s,"Then he is a developer of Dino"
8m26s,8m28s,"Okay, then you can put some"
8m28s,8m30s,"Some data"
8m30s,8m32s,"API key and your organization"
8m32s,8m34s,"Just assume that your account"
8m34s,8m35s,"Have more organization"
8m35s,8m37s,"Remember to set this"
8m37s,8m39s,"Then you can use the model you want to use"
8m39s,8m41s,"Now you can use the GPT 3.5"
8m41s,8m43s,"Turbo or say"
8m43s,8m45s,"You need a lot of tokens"
8m45s,8m48s,"Because GP3.5's token is the token of 409"
8m48s,8m50s,"Then you can change it to GPT4"
8m50s,8m52s,"You can use 8K token"
8m52s,8m53s,"Or 32K token"
8m53s,8m55s,"But its cost is"
8m55s,8m56s,"One is 15 times"
8m56s,8m57s,"One is 30 times"
8m57s,8m59s,"So everyone, be careful"
8m59s,9m0s,"If you need it"
9m0s,9m1s,"But basically if you just want to do"
9m1s,9m2s,"The card version"
9m2s,9m4s,"If you use GPT3.5"
9m4s,9m6s,"The terminal is very, very useful"
9m6s,9m8s,"Then the language"
9m8s,9m9s,"You basically use it now"
9m9s,9m10s,"Because of the language"
9m10s,9m12s,"You can change your card version"
9m12s,9m13s,"Chinese"
9m13s,9m14s,"Translate Chinese"
9m14s,9m15s,"Significance Chinese"
9m15s,9m16s,"And Japanese"
9m16s,9m17s,"The point is to use these three"
9m17s,9m19s,"Then I wrote a"
9m19s,9m20s,"Plastic function"
9m20s,9m21s,"Or sake"
9m21s,9m22s,"To make links"
9m22s,9m23s,"So you"
9m23s,9m25s,"You have been doing these sake and plastic"
9m25s,9m27s,"You can use this method to connect"
9m27s,9m29s,"This open AI"
9m29s,9m31s,"Then it's time out"
9m31s,9m32s,"This time out is to assume that your"
9m32s,9m35s,"Your token needs to look a lot"
9m35s,9m37s,"Sometimes open AI"
9m37s,9m38s,"Will be noisy because open AI"
9m38s,9m39s,"Too many people are using"
9m39s,9m41s,"So sometimes it's very slow"
9m41s,9m43s,"So you just adjust this type of"
9m43s,9m45s,"Then there is miss token"
9m45s,9m46s,"This token is that"
9m46s,9m48s,"When you reply"
9m48s,9m49s,"These words are too sour"
9m49s,9m50s,"In this"
9m50s,9m51s,"The token of completion"
9m51s,9m53s,"Then if you have a complete token"
9m53s,9m54s,"If not enough"
9m54s,9m55s,"You can increase it from here"
9m55s,9m56s,"That default is 300"
9m56s,9m57s,"But adjust this"
9m57s,9m58s,"The most important thing is"
9m58s,10m0s,"Because you are doing code review"
10m0s,10m1s,"Need this"
10m1s,10m2s,"good"
10m2s,10m3s,"good"
10m3s,10m4s,"Then there is also temperature"
10m4s,10m5s,"Temperature"
10m5s,10m6s,"This is the basic"
10m6s,10m7s,"Open AI parameters"
10m7s,10m8s,"0.7"
10m8s,10m11s,"0.0 to 0 to 2"
10m11s,10m12s,"Then the higher you are"
10m12s,10m13s,"The higher the answer is"
10m13s,10m14s,"The higher the answer"
10m14s,10m15s,"So don't be too high"
10m15s,10m16s,"Don't be too low"
10m16s,10m17s,"So everyone 0.7"
10m17s,10m19s,"This is the number of people on the Internet"
10m19s,10m21s,"There is another called"
10m21s,10m22s,"Diff Unify"
10m22s,10m23s,"This thing"
10m23s,10m24s,"I will add this"
10m24s,10m25s,"You can look at it"
10m25s,10m27s,"Sometimes I put this"
10m27s,10m28s,"Ok like this"
10m28s,10m29s,"You will see that"
10m29s,10m30s,"My Diff Nino"
10m30s,10m32s,"He has put the front and the back"
10m32s,10m33s,"All out"
10m33s,10m36s,"This is the thing that the Git is expected to do"
10m36s,10m37s,"But your Diff Nino"
10m37s,10m39s,"So it's growing in the Diff"
10m39s,10m41s,"That's your Git Diff"
10m41s,10m43s,"If you set this Unify to 0"
10m43s,10m44s,"Basically"
10m44s,10m46s,"He will only make this"
10m46s,10m47s,"Red and green"
10m47s,10m48s,"We can try it"
10m48s,10m53s,"Ok, there is a"
10m53s,10m56s,"There is a Diff thing"
10m56s,10m57s,"Anyway, this is"
10m57s,10m59s,"This is basically the adjustment"
10m59s,11m1s,"Can you think about it?"
11m1s,11m3s,"I want to see the front row"
11m3s,11m5s,"And the back row"
11m5s,11m6s,"The expected color is 3 rows"
11m6s,11m7s,"So basically you adjust"
11m7s,11m9s,"We give to the token"
11m9s,11m10s,"We give to Open AI"
11m10s,11m12s,"You can reduce the token amount"
11m12s,11m14s,"So this is also the benefit of reducing the token amount"
11m14s,11m17s,"So if your Diff Nino is very long"
11m17s,11m19s,"Basically you can adjust it a little"
11m19s,11m20s,"Will reduce some tokens"
11m20s,11m22s,"Then basically I think you can set it to 0"
11m22s,11m23s,"Because"
11m23s,11m27s,"Basically Open AI is looking at the front"
11m27s,11m28s,"The front and the back"
11m28s,11m30s,"The whole answer is not very big"
11m30s,11m32s,"So basically I set it to you"
11m32s,11m35s,"Ok, then there is the Isqulist"
11m35s,11m37s,"I think this is very, very useful"
11m37s,11m39s,"What does this thing do?"
11m39s,11m40s,"Suppose you change things"
11m40s,11m42s,"For example, that kind of package"
11m42s,11m44s,"The package is"
11m44s,11m46s,"NPN"
11m46s,11m47s,"NPN that confine"
11m47s,11m48s,"The function of the party"
11m48s,11m49s,"That actually has no use"
11m49s,11m50s,"Or the structure inside"
11m50s,11m52s,"For example, this structure"
11m52s,11m54s,"This thing actually has no use"
11m54s,11m55s,"Then send it to"
11m55s,11m57s,"Open AI and set the token amount"
11m57s,11m59s,"So basically I will choose this"
11m59s,12m1s,"So if it's similar, it's like this"
12m1s,12m4s,"Ok, let's think about it"
12m4s,12m5s,"For example, like this"
12m5s,12m7s,"I set it to you"
12m7s,12m8s,"Diff Unified"
12m8s,12m9s,"Then this Isqulist"
12m9s,12m10s,"I set it to you"
12m10s,12m11s,"Taste of Fire"
12m11s,12m14s,"That basically doesn't mean anything"
12m14s,12m15s,"We don't want to give Open AI"
12m15s,12m17s,"We don't want to give AI to look"
12m17s,12m19s,"But it's in this package"
12m19s,12m21s,"We can just tear it off"
12m21s,12m23s,"Basically this is the parameters"
12m23s,12m25s,"So this is what we just talked about"
12m25s,12m26s,"It can do"
12m26s,12m28s,"The preview of the package"
12m28s,12m29s,"You can also download the preview"
12m29s,12m31s,"The preview means that I don't"
12m31s,12m32s,"Do this"
12m32s,12m34s,"Make a package on the package"
12m34s,12m35s,"Help you make a package"
12m35s,12m36s,"Then you basically"
12m36s,12m38s,"You are still in the stagefire"
12m38s,12m40s,"Then this is the translation you wrote wrong"
12m40s,12m42s,"Then basically don't use this function"
12m42s,12m44s,"Don't translate the code into Chinese"
12m44s,12m46s,"Because the token amount of Chinese is quite large"
12m46s,12m48s,"So please use it carefully"
12m48s,12m51s,"Then this is the demo"
12m51s,12m55s,"Suppose you are not satisfied with the message of the previous package"
12m55s,12m57s,"You can always download this command"
12m57s,12m59s,"You can always modify the last package"
12m59s,13m2s,"Then there was a user before telling me"
13m2s,13m5s,"This package's format can be changed a little"
13m5s,13m7s,"No problem, you can define this template"
13m7s,13m9s,"Then there are several parameters"
13m9s,13m10s,"Summary of Preface"
13m10s,13m11s,"Summary of Title"
13m11s,13m12s,"Summary of Message"
13m12s,13m13s,"You can use it"
13m13s,13m15s,"So you can download a template"
13m15s,13m16s,"To change these things"
13m16s,13m17s,"Or a template fire"
13m17s,13m19s,"You can set it up"
13m19s,13m21s,"Okay, the key is not here"
13m21s,13m22s,"It's very simple"
13m22s,13m23s,"Install and uninstall"
13m23s,13m24s,"Then you can"
13m24s,13m25s,"GetAdder"
13m25s,13m26s,"After these fires"
13m26s,13m27s,"Then download a key to the package"
13m27s,13m29s,"It will jump out of a window"
13m29s,13m30s,"That is the window in the package"
13m30s,13m33s,"Then download the package of AI"
13m33s,13m35s,"So you see it's after this upgrade"
13m35s,13m37s,"It will make you a copy"
13m37s,13m38s,"So it's very simple"
13m38s,13m40s,"Then let's talk about a calling view"
13m40s,13m41s,"That calling view is very simple"
13m41s,13m42s,"It's the same as the key's calling view"
13m42s,13m44s,"Just say it doesn't help you make a copy"
13m44s,13m46s,"It helps you make a calling view"
13m46s,13m47s,"That's what it means"
13m47s,13m50s,"Okay, let's take a look at an example"
13m50s,13m52s,"Suppose we look at this code"
13m52s,13m55s,"Okay, let's test that PHP file"
13m55s,13m59s,"Okay, .mphp"
13m59s,14m2s,"Okay, let's put the file on"
14m2s,14m4s,"Okay, let's take a look at this"
14m4s,14m8s,"How to use this"
14m8s,14m10s,"CodeGPD"
14m10s,14m12s,"Okay, we are"
14m12s,14m14s,"Anyway, just use"
14m14s,14m15s,"Review"
14m15s,14m16s,"Let's do the next review"
14m16s,14m18s,"Okay, after the next review"
14m18s,14m21s,"It will look at the content in this stagefiring"
14m21s,14m24s,"Then it will start to do the review code change"
14m24s,14m25s,"Then this is really"
14m25s,14m26s,"It needs to take a while"
14m26s,14m29s,"Then you can spray these messages in the next time"
14m29s,14m32s,"In fact, this thing is actually very useful"
14m32s,14m35s,"In the beginning, I told you that it may have some"
14m35s,14m37s,"Some ingestion"
14m37s,14m40s,"So you have to go to verify your input"
14m40s,14m42s,"What is it? Enter the user's code"
14m42s,14m44s,"So I think these tools are very useful"
14m44s,14m46s,"It's five points for you"
14m46s,14m47s,"It's five points for you"
14m47s,14m49s,"So basically I hope this thing can continue"
14m49s,14m50s,"Our"
14m50s,14m51s,"RuntyCoverFloor"
14m51s,14m53s,"Every time the user sends PR"
14m53s,14m55s,"For example, your team is sending PR"
14m55s,14m57s,"I automatically"
14m57s,14m58s,"From your"
14m58s,14m59s,"From your code"
14m59s,15m0s,"All the content"
15m0s,15m2s,"Go to the code review to summarize"
15m2s,15m3s,"That summarizes"
15m3s,15m4s,"For you"
15m4s,15m5s,"Very useful"
15m5s,15m6s,"For the developer"
15m6s,15m8s,"It's very useful to send PR"
15m8s,15m10s,"For the reviewer, he can look at this first"
15m10s,15m12s,"He can look at this review"
15m12s,15m13s,"You know that you"
15m13s,15m15s,"What are you doing with your whole code"
15m15s,15m18s,"And what problems are happening"
15m18s,15m20s,"What suggestions do you have"
15m20s,15m22s,"Basically, it usually needs to say"
15m22s,15m23s,"Since there are some"
15m23s,15m24s,"Some ingestion"
15m24s,15m25s,"That's not you"
15m25s,15m27s,"But do you have to wait for you to fix it"
15m27s,15m28s,"I'll go and see"
15m28s,15m29s,"No problem"
15m29s,15m30s,"So basically I think the suggestions"
15m30s,15m32s,"The suggestions given by AI are very, very useful"
15m32s,15m33s,"Not just in"
15m33s,15m35s,"Code"
15m35s,15m37s,"The PHP is very much seen in the language"
15m37s,15m39s,"Because he almost finished"
15m39s,15m40s,"The GitHub code"
15m40s,15m42s,"That's the data of 2021"
15m42s,15m43s,"Then I think that"
15m43s,15m45s,"The whole model base"
15m45s,15m46s,"Has been very, very strong"
15m46s,15m47s,"So basically"
15m47s,15m48s,"He can see the language"
15m48s,15m52s,"Okay, that's what I'm going to introduce today"
15m52s,15m54s,"That's very useful"
15m54s,15m55s,"That's below"
15m55s,15m56s,"That's good"
15m56s,15m58s,"That's now China and Hong Kong"
15m58s,15m59s,"In fact, most companies"
15m59s,16m0s,"Are strict with the PHP"
16m0s,16m2s,"So this tool"
16m2s,16m3s,"I just developed"
16m3s,16m4s,"Process function"
16m4s,16m6s,"You can connect with the Sacky method"
16m6s,16m7s,"You can use the process method"
16m7s,16m9s,"Or visit OpenAI"
16m9s,16m10s,"Or say"
16m10s,16m12s,"If you have a base UI"
16m12s,16m14s,"If you have a Java or a proxy"
16m14s,16m15s,"It's okay"
16m15s,16m16s,"Okay, then if you want"
16m16s,16m17s,"I think the next step"
16m17s,16m19s,"Is Azure OpenAI"
16m19s,16m20s,"After coming in"
16m20s,16m22s,"He will support Azure OpenAI"
16m22s,16m23s,"Because OpenAI"
16m23s,16m25s,"The biggest share is software"
16m25s,16m27s,"That software is also"
16m27s,16m28s,"This thing is for the whole"
16m28s,16m29s,"When they are"
16m29s,16m31s,"The whole cloud service in Azure"
16m31s,16m33s,"So basically"
16m33s,16m34s,"We are"
16m34s,16m35s,"Most of the companies"
16m35s,16m36s,"It's impossible to go to OpenAI"
16m36s,16m37s,"To do the same"
16m37s,16m39s,"Because he didn't have the ability to say"
16m39s,16m40s,"He won't take your data"
16m40s,16m41s,"Do any"
16m41s,16m42s,"The full-time work"
16m42s,16m43s,"But the software"
16m43s,16m44s,"He is in this area"
16m44s,16m46s,"Is having the ability to say"
16m46s,16m48s,"We will never take your code"
16m48s,16m49s,"To do that"
16m49s,16m51s,"This is to sign with the software"
16m51s,16m52s,"The contract later"
16m52s,16m53s,"So this is the"
16m53s,16m55s,"The big company is going to the right place"
16m55s,16m56s,"good"
16m56s,16m57s,"Then I hope"
16m57s,16m58s,"I hope to introduce this tool today"
16m58s,16m59s,"Is to help everyone"
16m59s,17m0s,"If you like it"
17m0s,17m1s,"You can help me to click"
17m1s,17m2s,"Click on the heart"
17m2s,17m3s,"Click on the war"
17m3s,17m5s,"At present, I actually think it's a lot of people using it"
17m5s,17m7s,"So now it's probably more than 300 people"
17m7s,17m8s,"If you like it"
17m8s,17m9s,"Just help me introduce the goods"
17m9s,17m10s,"Promote it"
17m10s,17m11s,"Thank you all"
