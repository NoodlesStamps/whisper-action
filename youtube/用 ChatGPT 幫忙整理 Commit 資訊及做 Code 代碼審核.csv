0s,2s,"Hello, everyone, I am Buyi."
2s,5s,"This class will introduce a tool called"
5s,7s,"Use the TrueGPT Automation Developer"
7s,9s,"Create a coming message"
9s,12s,"I will explain the three important things later."
12s,14s,"The first is why the code is called "GPT""
14s,17s,"Let's introduce the TrueGPT"
17s,18s,"How to use it"
18s,20s,"Let's talk about the latest one."
20s,21s,"I use the new one."
21s,24s,"OK, everyone should not be unfamiliar with TrueGPT"
24s,28s,"Currently, it is AI, AIGC, AI Generator, Content"
28s,31s,"At present, when it comes to red-grinding machine"
31s,34s,"All the software development workers in the world are thinking about"
34s,38s,"How to use TrueGPT to help us develop the entire software process"
38s,41s,"Or improve our environment"
41s,43s,"And I am most important here"
43s,46s,"Use TrueGPT to write the KitKartMessage"
46s,48s,"How to write the KitKartMessage"
48s,50s,"You can refer to this article"
50s,52s,"I will put it in the link below"
52s,55s,"I directly use the source"
55s,57s,"The source is called CodeGPT"
57s,1m0s,"If you like it, you can share it with me"
1m0s,1m4s,"The main point is to help the software development"
1m4s,1m8s,"You can see CodeGPT creates the KitKartMessage effect"
1m8s,1m11s,"You write the code first"
1m11s,1m13s,"You have to write the KitKartMessage"
1m13s,1m15s,"For example, what does this function do"
1m15s,1m18s,"Or how do I solve this bug"
1m18s,1m22s,"You may want to say how to write the content"
1m22s,1m25s,"Let everyone know when they check"
1m25s,1m27s,"After we have CodeGPT"
1m27s,1m30s,"We use AI to help you see the whole KitKartMessage"
1m30s,1m33s,"We help to automatically create this content"
1m33s,1m35s,"You see this is the bottom effect"
1m35s,1m38s,"You see all the KartMessage here"
1m38s,1m40s,"All use this tool called CodeGPT"
1m40s,1m41s,"Help me create"
1m41s,1m42s,"Not me"
1m42s,1m45s,"Basically, 8 or 9% is correct"
1m45s,1m47s,"Basically, if you want to slightly tweak yourself"
1m47s,1m49s,"You can do the effect you want"
1m49s,1m52s,"Basically, if you have a long time to enter the code"
1m52s,1m55s,"That's also because I hope that the KartMessage you write"
1m55s,1m57s,"Is helpful to the team"
1m57s,2m1s,"This tool can help you to reduce a lot of time"
2m1s,2m3s,"Ok, then"
2m3s,2m5s,"I don't want to write CodeGPT"
2m5s,2m7s,"In fact, the KitKart platform has already"
2m7s,2m8s,"Similar tools like this"
2m8s,2m9s,"Why do you want to re-develop it"
2m9s,2m10s,"The first one is the cross-platform platform"
2m10s,2m12s,"I need to use the source"
2m12s,2m15s,"To avoid the different platforms and different environments"
2m15s,2m18s,"This is easier for developers who do not receive the environment"
2m18s,2m20s,"The second one is that my future plan is"
2m20s,2m23s,"The next GitHub, GitHub, Bbac and other platforms"
2m23s,2m26s,"After sending PR, you can automatically help"
2m26s,2m28s,"Help to organize the content of KartMessage"
2m28s,2m30s,"And automatically leave a message"
2m30s,2m32s,"Then this tool"
2m32s,2m34s,"So my development tool is not just a single developer"
2m34s,2m36s,"Can automatically create KartMessage"
2m36s,2m38s,"In the future, I hope that the whole"
2m38s,2m41s,"Can be motivated to help to do the code"
2m41s,2m43s,"Then the third reason is that in the future"
2m43s,2m46s,"I hope it's not just an open AI API"
2m46s,2m48s,"The current API of TrueGPT"
2m48s,2m50s,"Currently in Azure's API"
2m50s,2m52s,"Open AI has been supported"
2m52s,2m54s,"Next, let's talk about how to use it"
2m54s,2m55s,"Actually, it's very simple"
2m55s,2m57s,"Every time, the number of users will have"
2m57s,3m0s,"The corresponding self-sufficiency file of Linux, Mac OS Windows"
3m0s,3m2s,"You just need to send it to BIN"
3m2s,3m4s,"Then go to Open AI's website"
3m4s,3m6s,"Create an API key"
3m6s,3m8s,"Every month seems to be free 18 dollars"
3m8s,3m10s,"But I think this is already cheap"
3m10s,3m12s,"In fact, every day, you know"
3m12s,3m14s,"No matter how much you pay"
3m14s,3m16s,"3.5 turbo version is actually very cheap"
3m16s,3m18s,"So basically"
3m18s,3m20s,"KartMessage"
3m20s,3m22s,"Look at the token amount he has seen"
3m22s,3m24s,"Actually not even a dollar"
3m24s,3m26s,"It's quite cheap, so everyone's credit card is right"
3m26s,3m27s,"Because for you"
3m27s,3m29s,"It's very useful to write KartMessage"
3m29s,3m31s,"And you don't have to waste time to"
3m31s,3m33s,"The things you wrote"
3m33s,3m35s,"Okay, then"
3m35s,3m37s,"After everyone is done, you can use"
3m37s,3m39s,"We can install it"
3m39s,3m41s,"Let's take a look at this website"
3m42s,3m45s,"Ok, it's easy"
3m45s,3m47s,"You can download from this list"
3m47s,3m49s,"To the corresponding self-sufficiency file"
3m49s,3m51s,"You can download"
3m51s,3m53s,"The answer for your AUN 64 and AMD 64"
3m53s,3m55s,"Or Linux version"
3m55s,3m57s,"Or Windows version can be"
3m57s,3m59s,"Or you can say that you are very simple"
3m59s,4m1s,"If you use Mac, you can"
4m1s,4m3s,"You can use Blue install"
4m3s,4m5s,"Basically, it's blue tab"
4m5s,4m7s,"Apple Boy's Latch tab"
4m7s,4m9s,"Then install"
4m9s,4m11s,"Next is how to use"
4m11s,4m13s,"Set up your API key"
4m13s,4m15s,"It's really easy to use it"
4m15s,4m17s,"You can continue to use it after you create your API key"
4m17s,4m19s,"You just need to export this variable"
4m19s,4m21s,"Next, you will do the post-sale thing"
4m21s,4m23s,"Let's see how to use it at the bottom"
4m23s,4m25s,"Let's take a look"
4m25s,4m27s,"Let's take a look at the current"
4m27s,4m29s,"Communion"
4m29s,4m31s,"Because it's here"
4m31s,4m33s,"I changed something"
4m33s,4m35s,"Let's take a look at the GIT leaf"
4m37s,4m39s,"After I changed this"
4m39s,4m41s,"Let's take a look at it"
4m41s,4m43s,"Let's set it to"
4m43s,4m45s,"3 states"
4m45s,4m47s,"Next we have a code GPT"
4m47s,4m49s,"You can play hlp"
4m49s,4m51s,"You can see that it has many"
4m51s,4m53s,"Cami can be used"
4m53s,4m55s,"The first Cami"
4m55s,4m57s,"It will help you to auto-john"
4m57s,4m59s,"Then you can set your own camera"
4m59s,5m1s,"Let me introduce this a little bit"
5m1s,5m3s,"Then you can also use the GIT method"
5m3s,5m5s,"This is less useful"
5m5s,5m7s,"It will help you to set up a GIT hook"
5m7s,5m9s,"Under your GIT"
5m9s,5m11s,"Under your GIT"
5m11s,5m13s,"To change your Cami hook"
5m13s,5m15s,"Then you can automatically"
5m15s,5m17s,"Go to the message you sent"
5m17s,5m19s,"Then there is a most important function"
5m19s,5m21s,"It can go to the remote control"
5m21s,5m23s,"So I will introduce it later"
5m23s,5m25s,"Let's take a look at it"
5m25s,5m27s,"We are now in a stage state"
5m27s,5m29s,"There is a CND"
5m29s,5m31s,"I have changed this answer"
5m33s,5m35s,"In fact, it is to"
5m35s,5m37s,"Change a constant"
5m37s,5m38s,"Change it to a"
5m38s,5m40s,"The address of your own address"
5m40s,5m42s,"Then we use the code GPT Cami"
5m42s,5m44s,"So it will automatically"
5m44s,5m46s,"Use GPT 3.5's turbo version"
5m46s,5m48s,"After that, it will tell you"
5m48s,5m50s,"What is the summary of Cami"
5m50s,5m52s,"It will tell you the environment"
5m52s,5m54s,"Preface for consistency"
5m54s,5m55s,"Then it will tell you"
5m55s,5m57s,"The content inside it is"
5m57s,5m59s,"I changed the Github"
5m59s,6m1s,"Change the weight to the bottom"
6m1s,6m3s,"After that, it will write to you"
6m3s,6m5s,"Cami message"
6m5s,6m7s,"It automatically sends you Cami"
6m7s,6m9s,"So you can see that you are automatically changed"
6m9s,6m11s,"Like this"
6m11s,6m15s,"If you are not satisfied with this message"
6m15s,6m17s,"You can use another way"
6m17s,6m19s,"You can go to this"
6m19s,6m21s,"This is actually the same as your GIT Cami"
6m21s,6m23s,"You will go to the message of Cami"
6m23s,6m25s,"The message of Cami"
6m25s,6m27s,"The next step is to perform"
6m27s,6m29s,"GPT 3.5's turbo version"
6m29s,6m31s,"After that, it will go to"
6m31s,6m33s,"Change a new message"
6m33s,6m35s,"Until you change it"
6m35s,6m37s,"The message you want"
6m37s,6m39s,"So you can keep changing it"
6m39s,6m41s,"Of course, it will sign"
6m41s,6m43s,"The money of your calculation"
6m43s,6m45s,"So you see here, I tell you"
6m45s,6m47s,"How much is your PON token"
6m47s,6m49s,"Then how much is your comp"
6m49s,6m51s,"How much is the token used"
6m51s,6m53s,"Then the total token is these two"
6m53s,6m55s,"That's the last thing you want to pay"
6m55s,6m57s,"Now every 1000 tokens is 0.002"
6m57s,6m59s,"That's very cheap"
6m59s,7m1s,"So basically you use a lot of money every day"
7m1s,7m3s,"Almost not much"
7m3s,7m5s,"So you can save every day"
7m5s,7m7s,"To pay for the drinks"
7m7s,7m9s,"How much is your day saved"
7m9s,7m11s,"Cami message time"
7m11s,7m13s,"So I think it's pretty convenient"
7m13s,7m15s,"Let's look at the other parameters"
7m15s,7m17s,"How to use"
7m17s,7m19s,"In fact, we can go through a"
7m19s,7m21s,"Code GPT to use"
7m21s,7m23s,"Very hot time to set up some"
7m23s,7m25s,"Environmental data"
7m25s,7m27s,"After I wrote down the Open API"
7m27s,7m29s,"Basically, I don't have to"
7m29s,7m31s,"Go to eSports anymore"
7m31s,7m33s,"Because it will directly occupy"
7m33s,7m35s,"The code GPT"
7m35s,7m37s,"Code GPT.yaml"
7m37s,7m39s,"Write in this value"
7m39s,7m41s,"So basically you don't have to worry about it"
7m41s,7m43s,"Then openAI"
7m43s,7m45s,"OpenAI has a parameter"
7m45s,7m47s,"Basis, you are here now"
7m47s,7m49s,"Why this parameter is like this"
7m49s,7m51s,"You see now almost all companies"
7m51s,7m53s,"OpenAI's net worth is all blocked"
7m53s,7m55s,"After that, everyone is crazy"
7m55s,7m57s,"FullyÂÅá set"
7m57s,7m59s,"Fully Plastic"
7m59s,8m1s,"You can change this point to the best UI"
8m1s,8m3s,"I guess at the beginning"
8m3s,8m5s,"OpenAI should have found this problem"
8m5s,8m7s,"When the record is released"
8m7s,8m9s,"He told me that he can"
8m9s,8m11s,"Everyone can change the best UI"
8m11s,8m13s,"So you can change it to what you want"
8m13s,8m15s,"You can use this free"
8m15s,8m17s,"Many people think that my key is stolen"
8m17s,8m19s,"What are you doing"
8m19s,8m21s,"If I don't believe it, I can just go and add it myself"
8m21s,8m23s,"It's a Chinese developer"
8m23s,8m25s,"Then it's a Dino developer"
8m25s,8m27s,"Okay, then you can"
8m27s,8m29s,"Some data"
8m29s,8m31s,"API key"
8m31s,8m33s,"And your organization"
8m33s,8m35s,"There are more organizations in your account"
8m35s,8m37s,"Remember to set this"
8m37s,8m39s,"Then you can use the model you want to use"
8m39s,8m41s,"You can now use GPT 3.5"
8m41s,8m43s,"Turbo or you need"
8m43s,8m45s,"A lot of tokens because GP3.5"
8m45s,8m47s,"His token is the token of 409"
8m47s,8m49s,"Then you can change it to GPT4"
8m49s,8m51s,"Maybe you can use 8k tokens"
8m51s,8m53s,"Or 32k tokens"
8m53s,8m55s,"But his fee is"
8m55s,8m57s,"One is 15 times, one is 30 times"
8m57s,8m59s,"So please be careful"
8m59s,9m1s,"If you need it"
9m1s,9m3s,"If you just want to do the terminal"
9m3s,9m5s,"GPT 3.5 terminal is very useful"
9m5s,9m7s,"Then in terms of language"
9m7s,9m9s,"You basically use English"
9m9s,9m11s,"You can change your terminal"
9m11s,9m13s,"Translate into Chinese"
9m13s,9m15s,"Translate into Chinese, translate into Chinese and Japanese"
9m15s,9m17s,"The point is to use these three"
9m17s,9m19s,"Then I wrote a"
9m19s,9m21s,"Plastic function here"
9m21s,9m23s,"Or sake in the way of doing connection"
9m23s,9m25s,"So you have been doing these"
9m25s,9m27s,"Sake and Plastic"
9m27s,9m29s,"You can connect it in this way"
9m29s,9m31s,"Then it's time out"
9m31s,9m33s,"This time out is to assume your"
9m33s,9m35s,"Your token needs to look a lot"
9m35s,9m37s,"Sometimes"
9m37s,9m39s,"OpenAI will be noisy because OpenAI is too much"
9m39s,9m41s,"So sometimes it's very slow"
9m41s,9m43s,"So you just adjust this time"
9m43s,9m45s,"Then there is Miss Token"
9m45s,9m47s,"This token is that"
9m47s,9m49s,"When you reply"
9m49s,9m51s,"These words are too sour"
9m51s,9m53s,"In this token"
9m53s,9m55s,"If you don't use the token"
9m55s,9m57s,"You can increase it from here"
9m57s,9m59s,"The default is 300"
9m59s,10m1s,"But the main thing is that"
10m1s,10m3s,"When you are doing code review, you need this"
10m3s,10m5s,"good"
10m5s,10m7s,"Then there is also temperature"
10m7s,10m9s,"This is the basic parameters of OpenAI"
10m9s,10m11s,"0.7"
10m11s,10m13s,"0.0 to 0.2"
10m13s,10m15s,"Then the answer will be more and more"
10m15s,10m17s,"So don't be too high or too low"
10m17s,10m19s,"So 0.7 should be the parameters of this network"
10m19s,10m21s,"There is also a called"
10m21s,10m23s,"Diff Unify"
10m23s,10m25s,"I will add this"
10m25s,10m27s,"You can look at it"
10m27s,10m29s,"You will see that"
10m29s,10m31s,"My Diff Nino has"
10m31s,10m33s,"The front and the back are all leaked"
10m33s,10m35s,"This is the thing that the Git predicted"
10m35s,10m37s,"But your Diff Nino"
10m37s,10m39s,"So it's growing in the Diff"
10m39s,10m41s,"Suppose your Git Diff"
10m41s,10m43s,"If you put this Unify color as 0"
10m43s,10m45s,"Basically"
10m45s,10m47s,"It will only leak this red and green"
10m47s,10m49s,"Can we try"
10m49s,10m53s,"Basically it has a"
10m53s,10m55s,"There is a Diff thing"
10m55s,10m57s,"Anyway, this is"
10m57s,10m59s,"This is basically the adjustment"
10m59s,11m1s,"Can you think about it"
11m1s,11m3s,"I want to see the front"
11m3s,11m5s,"How many rows are there with the back"
11m5s,11m7s,"The prediction is three rows"
11m7s,11m9s,"So basically you adjust it"
11m9s,11m11s,"If we send it to OpenAI"
11m11s,11m13s,"Can reduce the token amount"
11m13s,11m15s,"So this is also a good thing to reduce the token amount"
11m15s,11m16s,"So if your"
11m16s,11m18s,"Your Diff Nino is very long"
11m18s,11m20s,"Basically you can adjust it a little"
11m20s,11m22s,"Then you can save some tokens"
11m22s,11m24s,"I think you can set it as 0"
11m24s,11m25s,"Because"
11m25s,11m27s,"Basically OpenAI"
11m27s,11m29s,"Look at the front and the back"
11m29s,11m31s,"The whole answer is not very big"
11m31s,11m33s,"So basically I set it as 0"
11m33s,11m34s,"OK"
11m34s,11m36s,"Then there is Isqulist"
11m36s,11m38s,"I think this is very useful"
11m38s,11m40s,"What are you doing"
11m40s,11m42s,"Suppose you change things such as"
11m42s,11m44s,"Package.JSON"
11m44s,11m46s,"Package is"
11m46s,11m48s,"MPN"
11m48s,11m50s,"There is no use in that"
11m50s,11m52s,"Or in GO"
11m52s,11m54s,"For example, this GO GO"
11m54s,11m56s,"This thing is actually useless"
11m56s,11m58s,"Then send it to OpenAI"
11m58s,12m0s,"And then the token amount is occupied"
12m0s,12m2s,"So basically I will choose this"
12m2s,12m4s,"So similar to this"
12m4s,12m5s,"OK"
12m5s,12m7s,"For example, like this"
12m7s,12m8s,"Diff Unify"
12m8s,12m9s,"Then Isqulist"
12m9s,12m10s,"I set it for example"
12m10s,12m11s,"You have Taste of Fire"
12m11s,12m12s,"That basically"
12m12s,12m14s,"There is no meaning"
12m14s,12m15s,"We don't want to give OpenAI"
12m15s,12m17s,"We don't want to give AI to look"
12m17s,12m19s,"But it is in this token amount"
12m19s,12m21s,"We can just drop it"
12m21s,12m23s,"Basically this is the parameters"
12m23s,12m25s,"So this is what we just talked about"
12m25s,12m26s,"It can do"
12m26s,12m28s,"The preview of the token amount"
12m28s,12m30s,"You can also download the preview"
12m30s,12m31s,"The first thing is that I don't"
12m31s,12m32s,"Do this"
12m32s,12m34s,"Do the token amount on the token"
12m34s,12m35s,"Help you do the token amount"
12m35s,12m37s,"Then you basically have Stained Fire"
12m37s,12m38s,"Still in"
12m38s,12m40s,"Then this is to write your wrong translation"
12m40s,12m42s,"Basically don't use this function"
12m42s,12m44s,"Don't translate the code into Chinese"
12m44s,12m46s,"Because the token amount of Chinese is quite large"
12m46s,12m48s,"So everyone please use it"
12m48s,12m50s,"Then this is"
12m50s,12m51s,"Just demoed"
12m51s,12m53s,"If you are not satisfied with the first"
12m53s,12m55s,"The code content of the first card"
12m55s,12m57s,"You can keep downloading this command"
12m57s,12m59s,"You can continue to modify the last card"
12m59s,13m2s,"Then there is a user who told me before"
13m2s,13m4s,"This card content is a little bit different from the format"
13m4s,13m5s,"Change it"
13m5s,13m6s,"No problem"
13m6s,13m8s,"You can define this template"
13m8s,13m9s,"There are several parameters"
13m9s,13m10s,"Summary of Preface"
13m10s,13m11s,"Summary of Title"
13m11s,13m12s,"Summary of Message"
13m12s,13m13s,"You can use it"
13m13s,13m14s,"So you can download a"
13m14s,13m15s,"Template Stream"
13m15s,13m16s,"To change these things"
13m16s,13m17s,"Or Template Fire"
13m17s,13m19s,"You can set it up"
13m19s,13m22s,"Okay, it's not here to talk about the key"
13m22s,13m23s,"Install and Uninstall"
13m23s,13m24s,"Then you can"
13m24s,13m25s,"Get Add"
13m25s,13m26s,"After these fires"
13m26s,13m27s,"Next key card"
13m27s,13m29s,"It will jump out of a window"
13m29s,13m30s,"That is the window in the card"
13m30s,13m31s,"Then put the AI"
13m31s,13m33s,"The layer of the layer of AI"
13m33s,13m34s,"Go down"
13m34s,13m36s,"So you see it's going to help you do the code"
13m36s,13m38s,"So it's very simple"
13m38s,13m40s,"Then let's talk about a calling"
13m40s,13m41s,"That calling is not very easy"
13m41s,13m42s,"It's the same as the key card"
13m42s,13m44s,"Just say it doesn't help you do the code"
13m44s,13m46s,"It helps you do the call review"
13m46s,13m47s,"That's what it means"
13m47s,13m48s,"Okay, let's do the same"
13m48s,13m50s,"Let's take a look at an example"
13m50s,13m52s,"Suppose we let's take a look at this code"
13m52s,13m53s,"Okay"
13m53s,13m55s,"Let's go to the PHP file"
13m55s,13m56s,"Okay"
13m56s,13m58s,"Click on the front"
13m58s,13m59s,"HP"
13m59s,14m0s,"Okay"
14m0s,14m1s,"Then the same"
14m1s,14m3s,"Let's put the key card on it"
14m3s,14m5s,"Okay, let's take a look at this"
14m5s,14m7s,"How to use it"
14m7s,14m11s,"Code to the PHP"
14m11s,14m12s,"Okay"
14m12s,14m13s,"We are"
14m13s,14m14s,"Anyway, just use"
14m14s,14m15s,"Review"
14m15s,14m16s,"Let's do the next review"
14m16s,14m17s,"Okay"
14m17s,14m18s,"After the next review"
14m18s,14m21s,"It will go to the content in the Stage Fire"
14m21s,14m24s,"Then it will start to do the review code change"
14m24s,14m25s,"Then this is really"
14m25s,14m27s,"It needs to be spent a period of time"
14m27s,14m29s,"Then you can spray these"
14m29s,14m30s,"These reviews"
14m30s,14m32s,"In fact, this thing is actually very useful"
14m32s,14m35s,"The reviewer told you that it may have some"
14m35s,14m37s,"Some ingestion"
14m37s,14m38s,"So you have to go to"
14m38s,14m40s,"To verify your input and what"
14m40s,14m42s,"Enter the show as a card"
14m42s,14m43s,"So I think these"
14m43s,14m44s,"The tools are very useful"
14m44s,14m46s,"It's five points for you"
14m46s,14m47s,"It's five points for you"
14m47s,14m49s,"So basically I hope this thing can be used"
14m49s,14m50s,"Our"
14m50s,14m51s,"The software is open"
14m51s,14m53s,"Every time the user posts a PR"
14m53s,14m54s,"For example, your team"
14m54s,14m56s,"The team is posting a PR"
14m56s,14m57s,"It's automatic"
14m57s,14m58s,"From your"
14m58s,14m59s,"From your card"
14m59s,15m0s,"All the content in it"
15m0s,15m1s,"Go to the code review"
15m1s,15m2s,"Give a summarize"
15m2s,15m3s,"That this summarize"
15m3s,15m5s,"Is very useful to you"
15m5s,15m6s,"For the developer"
15m6s,15m8s,"It's very useful to the developer"
15m8s,15m9s,"Then for the reviewer"
15m9s,15m10s,"He can look at this first"
15m10s,15m11s,"He can look at this review"
15m11s,15m12s,"Summon"
15m12s,15m13s,"You know that you"
15m13s,15m15s,"What are you doing with this whole code"
15m15s,15m17s,"And maybe some"
15m17s,15m18s,"What are the problems in the first"
15m18s,15m20s,"And what suggestions do you give"
15m20s,15m21s,"Basically"
15m21s,15m22s,"Usually need to say"
15m22s,15m23s,"He actually has some"
15m23s,15m24s,"Some ingestion"
15m24s,15m25s,"That's not you"
15m25s,15m26s,"But do you have to wait for you to fix it"
15m26s,15m27s,"I'll go and see"
15m27s,15m28s,"No problem"
15m28s,15m29s,"So basically I think"
15m29s,15m30s,"The suggestions given by AI"
15m30s,15m31s,"Are very, very useful"
15m31s,15m33s,"Not just in"
15m33s,15m34s,"Code"
15m34s,15m37s,"The code is very much"
15m37s,15m38s,"Because he almost"
15m38s,15m39s,"I've finished looking at the game"
15m39s,15m41s,"That's the data of 2021"
15m41s,15m42s,"Then I think that"
15m42s,15m44s,"The whole model base"
15m44s,15m45s,"Has been very, very strong"
15m45s,15m46s,"So basically"
15m46s,15m48s,"He can look at the language"
15m48s,15m49s,"Okay"
15m49s,15m51s,"That's what I'm going to introduce today"
15m51s,15m52s,"I think this is very useful"
15m52s,15m54s,"Then below is that"
15m54s,15m55s,"Okay"
15m55s,15m56s,"Then now it's China and Hong Kong"
15m56s,15m57s,"Actually"
15m57s,15m59s,"Most companies are strict about the transparency"
15m59s,16m0s,"So this tool"
16m0s,16m2s,"I just developed"
16m2s,16m3s,"Process function"
16m3s,16m4s,"Can be connected to the sake"
16m4s,16m6s,"You can connect through the process"
16m6s,16m7s,"Or go to"
16m7s,16m8s,"Ask OpenAI"
16m8s,16m9s,"Or if you have"
16m9s,16m10s,"If you have a base UI"
16m10s,16m11s,"You can add a form"
16m11s,16m12s,"Or pass it"
16m12s,16m13s,"It's okay"
16m13s,16m14s,"Okay"
16m14s,16m15s,"If you expect it"
16m15s,16m16s,"I think the next step"
16m16s,16m17s,"Is to open the whole of the age"
16m17s,16m18s,"After coming in"
16m18s,16m19s,"He will support"
16m19s,16m20s,"OpenAI"
16m20s,16m21s,"He will support"
16m21s,16m22s,"Age of OpenAI"
16m22s,16m23s,"Because OpenAI"
16m23s,16m25s,"The biggest share is"
16m25s,16m26s,"Microsoft"
16m26s,16m27s,"Microsoft is also"
16m27s,16m28s,"This thing"
16m28s,16m29s,"Combined with their"
16m29s,16m31s,"The whole age of the whole cloud service"
16m31s,16m33s,"So basically"
16m33s,16m34s,"We are"
16m34s,16m35s,"Most of the companies"
16m35s,16m36s,"It's impossible to go to the OpenAI"
16m36s,16m37s,"To do the same"
16m37s,16m39s,"Because he didn't have the ability to say"
16m39s,16m40s,"He won't take your data"
16m40s,16m41s,"Do any"
16m41s,16m42s,"The full-time work"
16m42s,16m43s,"But Microsoft"
16m43s,16m44s,"He is in this area"
16m44s,16m46s,"Is having the ability to say"
16m46s,16m47s,"We will never go"
16m47s,16m48s,"Where to go"
16m48s,16m49s,"To do that"
16m49s,16m50s,"This is the right thing"
16m50s,16m51s,"This is to sign with Microsoft"
16m51s,16m52s,"The contract after that"
16m52s,16m53s,"So this is"
16m53s,16m55s,"The big company is going to go to the right place"
16m55s,16m56s,"good"
16m56s,16m57s,"I hope"
16m57s,16m58s,"I hope that the introduction of this tool"
16m58s,16m59s,"Is helpful to everyone"
16m59s,17m0s,"If you like it"
17m0s,17m1s,"You can help me"
17m1s,17m2s,"Go to the new one"
17m2s,17m3s,"Click on the war"
17m3s,17m4s,"At present, in fact, I think"
17m4s,17m5s,"There are quite a lot of people using it"
17m5s,17m6s,"So now it's probably"
17m6s,17m7s,"More than 300 people"
17m7s,17m8s,"If you like it"
17m8s,17m9s,"Just help me introduce the goods"
17m9s,17m10s,"Promote"
17m10s,17m11s,"Thank you all"
