2s,4.68s,"This class will introduce a tool called"
4.68s,7.02s,"Use the TrueGPT automatic development"
7.02s,8.52s,"Create a coming message"
8.52s,11.64s,"I will explain three important things later"
11.64s,14.28s,"The first is why the model is called GBT"
14.28s,16.72s,"Let's introduce the TrueGPT"
16.72s,17.88s,"How to use"
17.88s,19.48s,"Let's talk about the latest one"
19.48s,20.64s,"I used the new one"
20.64s,21.44s,"OK"
21.44s,23.96s,"Everyone is not unfamiliar with TrueGPT"
23.96s,28.12s,"Currently, it is AI, AIGC, AI generator content"
28.12s,30.8s,"At present, when the red bomb machine"
30.8s,33.76s,"All the software development in the world is thinking about"
33.76s,37.76s,"How to use TrueGPT to help us develop the entire software process"
37.76s,39.76s,"Or improve our"
39.76s,41.28s,"Use or environment"
41.28s,42.76s,"And I am here"
42.76s,44.88s,"The most important thing is to use TrueGPT to help you write"
44.88s,46.2s,"KitKamiMessage"
46.2s,48.52s,"How to write KitKamiMessage"
48.52s,50.16s,"You can refer to this article"
50.16s,52.12s,"Then I will probably put it below"
52.12s,52.6s,"OK"
52.6s,53.36s,"I am here"
53.36s,54.68s,"I directly use the structure"
54.68s,57.48s,"Write a CEO to provide a code GBT"
57.48s,59.92s,"If you like it, you can share it with me"
59.92s,1m2.64s,"The most important thing is to help the software"
1m2.64s,1m4.68s,"The software control is to organize the content"
1m4.68s,1m6.44s,"You can see the effect of code GBT"
1m6.44s,1m8.4s,"Create KitKamiMessage"
1m8.4s,1m11s,"That is, you write the code today"
1m11s,1m13.4s,"You have to organize KitKamiMessage"
1m13.4s,1m14.88s,"For example, what does this function do"
1m14.88s,1m16.44s,"Or this bug"
1m16.44s,1m18.2s,"How to solve it"
1m18.2s,1m19.56s,"Then you may want to say"
1m19.56s,1m22.04s,"How to write this content"
1m22.04s,1m23.8s,"Let everyone check it later"
1m23.8s,1m24.76s,"Very good"
1m24.76s,1m26.4s,"Then we don't have code GBT"
1m26.4s,1m30.36s,"We use AI to help you to see the whole KitKamiMessage"
1m30.36s,1m32.52s,"We help to automatically create this content"
1m32.52s,1m34.72s,"You see this is the bottom effect"
1m34.72s,1m37.44s,"You see all of my KamiMessage"
1m37.44s,1m39.88s,"All use this set of tools called code GBT"
1m39.88s,1m40.72s,"Help me create"
1m40.72s,1m42.2s,"Not me"
1m42.2s,1m43.4s,"That's basically"
1m43.4s,1m44.68s,"89% is correct"
1m44.68s,1m45.16s,"That's basically"
1m45.16s,1m46.84s,"You just have to slightly adjust yourself"
1m46.84s,1m48.52s,"You can do what you want"
1m48.52s,1m50.36s,"So basically if you are"
1m50.36s,1m52.2s,"Long time in the code for others"
1m52.2s,1m53.16s,"That's also"
1m53.16s,1m55.28s,"I hope you write your own KamiMessage"
1m55.28s,1m57.24s,"If you have any help"
1m57.24s,1m59.44s,"This tool can help you to improve"
1m59.44s,2m1.44s,"There are many times"
2m1.44s,2m2.08s,"good"
2m2.08s,2m3.08s,"Then"
2m3.08s,2m4.48s,"I don't write code GBT"
2m4.48s,2m7.44s,"In fact, there are already more than this kind of tools on the GitHub platform"
2m7.44s,2m8.96s,"Why do you want to re-develop it"
2m8.96s,2m10.28s,"The first one is the cross-platform platform"
2m10.28s,2m12.72s,"I need to use the source of the code to distribute it to the private sector"
2m12.72s,2m13.68s,"To avoid the different platforms"
2m13.68s,2m14.96s,"The different environments"
2m14.96s,2m18.32s,"This is easier for developers who do not receive the environment"
2m18.32s,2m20.32s,"The second one is that my future plans are to say"
2m20.32s,2m23.08s,"After the GitHub, the Git, the Bbac and other Git platforms"
2m23.08s,2m25.64s,"After sending PR, you can use the chat GBT"
2m25.64s,2m28.72s,"Help you to organize the content of KamiMessage"
2m28.72s,2m29.92s,"And the chat"
2m29.92s,2m31.8s,"Then this tool"
2m31.8s,2m34.16s,"So my development tool is not just for developers"
2m34.16s,2m36.12s,"Can automatically produce KamiMessage"
2m36.12s,2m37.8s,"In the future, I hope that it can"
2m37.8s,2m41.04s,"Can be a tool to help you to do the code review"
2m41.04s,2m42.24s,"Then the third reason is"
2m42.24s,2m43.28s,"In the future"
2m43.28s,2m45.8s,"I hope it's not just the open AI API"
2m45.8s,2m47.8s,"The chat GBT API"
2m47.8s,2m49.72s,"Currently in the A9 API"
2m49.72s,2m51.28s,"Open AI has been supported"
2m51.28s,2m53.52s,"Okay, let's talk about the way to use it"
2m53.52s,2m54.44s,"Actually, it's very simple"
2m54.44s,2m56.4s,"Every time there will be"
2m56.4s,2m57.8s,"Linux Mac OS Windows"
2m57.8s,2m59.92s,"Download the corresponding private sector"
2m59.92s,3m1.84s,"You just need to download and send it to BIM"
3m1.84s,3m3.36s,"Then go to the open AI website"
3m3.36s,3m5.36s,"Then you can create an API key"
3m5.36s,3m7.96s,"Every month seems to be free 18 USD"
3m7.96s,3m10.16s,"But I think this is already cheap"
3m10.16s,3m11.56s,"In fact, every day you know"
3m11.56s,3m12.88s,"No matter how much you Kami"
3m12.88s,3m15.36s,"Now it's a true GBT 3.5 Turbo version"
3m15.36s,3m16.72s,"It's actually very cheap"
3m16.72s,3m17.92s,"So basically you"
3m17.92s,3m19.84s,"Kami's message"
3m19.84s,3m22s,"He saw the token number"
3m22s,3m23.28s,"Actually not even a dollar"
3m23.28s,3m23.8s,"It's quite cheap"
3m23.8s,3m25.52s,"So everyone put the credit card on it"
3m25.52s,3m26.56s,"Because your"
3m26.56s,3m28.2s,"For your KamiMessage"
3m28.2s,3m28.96s,"Very useful"
3m28.96s,3m30.08s,"And you don't have to waste time"
3m30.08s,3m31.6s,"To organize your own"
3m31.6s,3m33.48s,"Write things"
3m33.48s,3m34.08s,"good"
3m34.08s,3m35.52s,"Then when you finish"
3m35.52s,3m36.8s,"Actually you can use"
3m36.8s,3m37.88s,"I don't want to go to Insta"
3m37.88s,3m39.28s,"We can take a look"
3m39.28s,3m41.28s,"Let's take a look at this website"
3m41.28s,3m44.8s,"good"
3m44.8s,3m45.24s,"Very simple"
3m45.24s,3m47.2s,"You can download from this list"
3m47.2s,3m48.88s,"To the corresponding private sector"
3m48.88s,3m50.56s,"You can go"
3m50.56s,3m51.52s,"Download the answer"
3m51.52s,3m52.72s,"64 with the AND"
3m52.72s,3m54.08s,"Or the Linux version"
3m54.08s,3m55.68s,"Or the Windows version"
3m55.68s,3m57.28s,"Or you"
3m57.28s,3m57.84s,"Very simple"
3m57.84s,3m59.12s,"If you use Mac"
3m59.12s,4m1.08s,"You can use"
4m1.08s,4m3.12s,"Just use Blue install"
4m3.12s,4m4.96s,"Basically, just use the tab"
4m4.96s,4m6.44s,"Apple Boy's stage tab"
4m6.44s,4m8.2s,"Then install"
4m8.2s,4m9.44s,"Then the next step is"
4m9.44s,4m11.68s,"How to use"
4m11.68s,4m13.48s,"Set up your API key"
4m13.48s,4m14.16s,"Then this is very simple"
4m14.16s,4m15.56s,"After you generate your API key"
4m15.56s,4m16.92s,"You can continue to use it"
4m16.92s,4m18.56s,"You just need to export this variable"
4m18.56s,4m20.76s,"Then you will do the back-up thing"
4m20.76s,4m21.32s,"good"
4m21.32s,4m23.04s,"Let's see how to use it at the bottom"
4m23.04s,4m24.04s,"good"
4m24.04s,4m25.24s,"Let's take a look"
4m25.24s,4m27.76s,"Let's take a look at the current"
4m27.76s,4m29.04s,"KamiMessage"
4m29.04s,4m29.44s,"good"
4m29.44s,4m30.4s,"Because it's here"
4m30.4s,4m32.4s,"I changed one thing"
4m32.4s,4m33.28s,"Then let's take a look at"
4m33.28s,4m34.68s,"GITDIF"
4m34.68s,4m37s,"good"
4m37s,4m37.36s,"Look at me"
4m37.36s,4m38.36s,"After I change this"
4m38.36s,4m40.6s,"Let's take a look at what he wants to do"
4m40.6s,4m42.44s,"Let's set it to"
4m42.44s,4m43.48s,"The third state"
4m43.48s,4m43.72s,"good"
4m43.72s,4m45.56s,"Next we have code gbt"
4m45.56s,4m46.52s,"This KamiMessage"
4m46.52s,4m48.24s,"You can play hlp"
4m48.24s,4m49.96s,"You can see that he has a lot of"
4m49.96s,4m50.96s,"Kami can use"
4m50.96s,4m52.24s,"The first Kami"
4m52.24s,4m54.68s,"He will help you to auto generate a KamiMessage"
4m54.68s,4m56.72s,"Then you can set up your own KamiMessage"
4m56.72s,4m58.36s,"Let me introduce this a little more"
4m58.36s,5m1.68s,"Then you can also use the GIT hook method to do it"
5m1.68s,5m3.36s,"Then this is less useful"
5m3.36s,5m5.4s,"If you need it, you can also use it"
5m5.4s,5m7.56s,"He will help you to press a GIT hook"
5m7.56s,5m8.48s,"At your"
5m8.48s,5m9.56s,"At your point"
5m9.56s,5m10.92s,"Under the point GIT"
5m10.92s,5m13.2s,"To change your Kami hook"
5m13.2s,5m17.68s,"Then you can automatically send the message to the user every time you use the KamiMessage"
5m17.68s,5m19.6s,"Then he has the most important function"
5m19.6s,5m21.36s,"He can go to the remote control"
5m21.36s,5m22.76s,"So this is also introduced"
5m22.76s,5m23.16s,"Ok"
5m23.16s,5m24.12s,"Let's take a look at it"
5m24.12s,5m26.2s,"Because we are now in a stage state"
5m26.2s,5m27.12s,"There is a"
5m27.12s,5m28.32s,"CND"
5m28.32s,5m29.56s,"The code is changed by the answer"
5m29.56s,5m30.76s,"Let's take a look at the content"
5m30.76s,5m35.04s,"Ok, in fact, just change"
5m35.04s,5m35.96s,"Change a"
5m35.96s,5m37.24s,"The variable of the constant"
5m37.24s,5m38.16s,"Change it to a"
5m38.16s,5m39.52s,"The order of your own"
5m39.52s,5m41.72s,"Ok, then we just use the code gbt"
5m41.72s,5m42.88s,"Kami"
5m42.88s,5m44.88s,"So he will automatically use"
5m44.88s,5m46.92s,"Gbt 3.5 turbo version"
5m46.92s,5m49.56s,"Then he will tell you what is the Kami summary"
5m49.56s,5m51.6s,"He will tell you the variable of the update environment"
5m51.6s,5m54s,"Preface for consistency"
5m54s,5m56.36s,"Then he will be able to say that the content inside it is"
5m56.36s,5m58.76s,"I changed the Github into input"
5m58.76s,5m59.96s,"Change the weight to the bottom"
5m59.96s,6m0.96s,"The weight of the text"
6m0.96s,6m2.44s,"Then after finishing it"
6m2.44s,6m4.24s,"He basically wrote it to you"
6m4.24s,6m5.08s,"A KamiMessage"
6m5.08s,6m6.12s,"He automatically changed it"
6m6.12s,6m7.36s,"So you can see"
6m7.36s,6m10s,"You are automatically changed to this"
6m10s,6m10.92s,"Ok"
6m10.92s,6m11.52s,"Ok"
6m11.52s,6m14.84s,"If you are not satisfied with this message"
6m14.84s,6m16.52s,"You can use another method"
6m16.52s,6m17.8s,"You can go down"
6m17.8s,6m18.84s,"This"
6m18.84s,6m21.12s,"Then this is actually with your Github Kami"
6m21.12s,6m21.76s,"The content is the same"
6m21.76s,6m24.52s,"You will go to change the Kami message"
6m24.52s,6m25.52s,"Ok, we will do it next"
6m25.52s,6m26.76s,"He must be doing"
6m26.76s,6m28.56s,"GPD 3.5 turbo version"
6m28.56s,6m32.24s,"After that, he will go to change a new message"
6m32.24s,6m34.12s,"Ok, until you change"
6m34.12s,6m35.2s,"The message you want"
6m35.2s,6m36.64s,"The message you want"
6m36.64s,6m38.52s,"So you can keep changing"
6m38.52s,6m39.52s,"Of course"
6m39.52s,6m41.28s,"It's all signed to your"
6m41.28s,6m42.52s,"The token money"
6m42.52s,6m43.48s,"So you see"
6m43.48s,6m44.44s,"Here I tell you"
6m44.44s,6m47.12s,"How much is your Pond token"
6m47.12s,6m49.6s,"Then how much is your Confirmation token"
6m49.6s,6m51.88s,"Then the total token here is these two"
6m51.88s,6m54.36s,"That's the last thing you want to pay"
6m54.36s,6m57.16s,"Now every 1000 tokens is 0.002 US dollars"
6m57.16s,6m57.96s,"That's very cheap"
6m57.96s,7m0.16s,"So basically you use it every day"
7m0.16s,7m1.36s,"Almost not much"
7m1.36s,7m2.44s,"More than 1 US dollars"
7m2.44s,7m4.68s,"So you can save every day"
7m4.68s,7m5.76s,"Go to the money to order a drink"
7m5.76s,7m7.36s,"In fact, you can save a day"
7m7.36s,7m9.84s,"How much is your KamiMessage"
7m9.84s,7m11.2s,"So I think it's basically"
7m11.2s,7m12.4s,"Pretty convenient"
7m12.4s,7m13.88s,"How to use other parameters"
7m13.88s,7m16.2s,"Let's take a look at the Internet"
7m16.2s,7m17.72s,"Ok, then in fact"
7m17.72s,7m20.04s,"We can go through a code GPT"
7m20.04s,7m21.6s,"Use Confirmation token"
7m21.6s,7m24.12s,"Go to set some environmental parameters"
7m24.12s,7m24.84s,"For example"
7m24.84s,7m27.6s,"Ok, I wrote the Open API in there"
7m27.6s,7m29.8s,"Basically, I don't have to go to eSport anymore"
7m29.8s,7m31.32s,"Because it will directly win"
7m31.32s,7m32.36s,"The store under the screen"
7m32.36s,7m33.08s,"Confirmation token"
7m33.08s,7m34.52s,"Code GPT store"
7m34.52s,7m35.4s,"Code GPT store"
7m35.4s,7m37.96s,"The answer is to write in these settings"
7m37.96s,7m38.88s,"Then it's all written"
7m38.88s,7m41s,"So basically you don't have to worry about it"
7m41s,7m42.52s,"Then what about Open API"
7m42.52s,7m44.12s,"Open API has a function"
7m44.12s,7m45s,"Base"
7m45s,7m45.6s,"UIL"
7m45.6s,7m47.84s,"Why does this function have this function"
7m47.84s,7m49.52s,"You see now all companies"
7m49.52s,7m51s,"Almost all of this"
7m51s,7m53s,"Open API's king is all blocked"
7m53s,7m54.44s,"After that, everyone is crazy"
7m54.44s,7m55.6s,"Crazy fake"
7m55.6s,7m56.76s,"For all the plus"
7m56.76s,7m57.56s,"For all the plus"
7m57.56s,7m58.96s,"You can change this point"
7m58.96s,8m0.52s,"Base UIL"
8m0.52s,8m2s,"Then I guess at the beginning"
8m2s,8m3.2s,"Open API should have"
8m3.2s,8m4.4s,"Found this problem"
8m4.4s,8m5.72s,"When the record is released"
8m5.72s,8m8.32s,"He told me that he can point"
8m8.32s,8m9.92s,"Everyone's base UIL can be changed"
8m9.92s,8m11.64s,"So you can change it to what you want"
8m11.64s,8m13.92s,"Then everyone can use this free"
8m13.92s,8m15.32s,"Then many people will say"
8m15.32s,8m16.32s,"Hey, my key is stolen"
8m16.32s,8m17.84s,"What are you doing"
8m17.84s,8m20s,"If I don't believe it, I'll just go and get it myself"
8m20s,8m22.4s,"Then this is a Chinese developer"
8m22.4s,8m23.24s,"The price"
8m23.24s,8m25.48s,"Then it is a Dino developer"
8m25.48s,8m27.68s,"Ok, then you can turn some"
8m27.68s,8m29.76s,"Some data to the computer"
8m29.76s,8m32.16s,"API key and your organization"
8m32.16s,8m34.96s,"Just assume that your account has more than one organization"
8m34.96s,8m36.24s,"Remember to set this"
8m36.24s,8m38.92s,"Ok, then you can use the model you want"
8m38.92s,8m41.48s,"Then you can use the GPT 3.5 Turbo now"
8m41.48s,8m44.04s,"Or you need a bigger token"
8m44.04s,8m44.88s,"Because GPT 3.5"
8m44.88s,8m47.72s,"Its token is a token of 409"
8m47.72s,8m49.48s,"Then you can change it to GPT4"
8m49.48s,8m51.48s,"Maybe you can use 8K token"
8m51.48s,8m52.96s,"Or 32K token"
8m52.96s,8m55.12s,"But its cost is"
8m55.12s,8m56.12s,"One is 15 times"
8m56.12s,8m57.08s,"One is 30 times"
8m57.08s,8m58.56s,"So everyone, be careful"
8m58.56s,8m59.72s,"If you need it"
8m59.72s,9m1.2s,"But basically if you just want to do"
9m1.2s,9m3.08s,"Carman's Bureau and Review Code"
9m3.08s,9m4.4s,"GPT 3.5 Turbo"
9m4.4s,9m5.8s,"It's very, very useful"
9m5.8s,9m7.56s,"Then in terms of language"
9m7.56s,9m9.96s,"You basically have the language"
9m9.96s,9m12.04s,"You can change your Carman's Bureau to"
9m12.04s,9m13.32s,"Chinese"
9m13.32s,9m15.4s,"Translate Chinese, sign language, and Japanese"
9m15.4s,9m17.2s,"The purpose is to change these three types"
9m17.2s,9m19.44s,"Then I have a more written"
9m19.44s,9m20.4s,"Plastic function"
9m20.4s,9m22.12s,"Or Saki's house to make links"
9m22.12s,9m22.8s,"So you"
9m22.8s,9m25.8s,"You have been doing these Saki and Plastic"
9m25.8s,9m27.56s,"You can connect it in this way"
9m27.56s,9m29.28s,"This is the UI of OpenAI"
9m29.28s,9m30.88s,"Ok, then this is the Type-Out"
9m30.88s,9m32.48s,"This Type-Out is to assume that your"
9m32.48s,9m33.32s,"Carman's Bureau"
9m33.32s,9m35.92s,"Your token needs to look a lot"
9m35.92s,9m36.68s,"Sometimes"
9m36.68s,9m38.16s,"OpenAI will be noisy because"
9m38.16s,9m39.28s,"OpenAI is too much to use"
9m39.28s,9m40.92s,"So sometimes it will be very slow"
9m40.92s,9m43.16s,"So you just adjust the Type-Out"
9m43.16s,9m45.08s,"Ok, then there is Miss Token"
9m45.08s,9m46.2s,"This token is that"
9m46.2s,9m47.8s,"When you reply"
9m47.8s,9m49.84s,"These words are too"
9m49.84s,9m51.48s,"Compression Token"
9m51.48s,9m53.08s,"If you don't use Compression Token"
9m53.08s,9m55.4s,"If you don't use it, you can increase it from here"
9m55.4s,9m56.76s,"That default is 300"
9m56.76s,9m58.4s,"But the main thing is to adjust this"
9m58.4s,10m1.36s,"Because you need this when you are doing the Code Review"
10m1.36s,10m2.04s,"Ok"
10m2.04s,10m4.92s,"Ok, then there is Temperature"
10m4.92s,10m6.92s,"But this is the basic"
10m6.92s,10m7.96s,"The parameters of OpenAI"
10m7.96s,10m9.16s,"0.7"
10m9.16s,10m12.04s,"0.0 to 0.2"
10m12.04s,10m14.36s,"Then the higher you are, the higher the answer"
10m14.36s,10m15.84s,"So don't be too high or too low"
10m15.84s,10m17.16s,"So 0.7 should be"
10m17.16s,10m19.2s,"This is the parameters of the network"
10m19.2s,10m20.68s,"Ok, then there is a called"
10m20.68s,10m21.64s,"Diff Unify"
10m21.64s,10m22.36s,"This thing"
10m22.36s,10m23.68s,"I will introduce this"
10m23.68s,10m25.12s,"You can look at it"
10m25.12s,10m26.76s,"Sometimes I put this command"
10m26.76s,10m27.92s,"Ok, that's it"
10m27.92s,10m29s,"You will see that"
10m29s,10m30.44s,"My Diffnet has"
10m30.44s,10m33.24s,"The front and the back three are all connected"
10m33.72s,10m35.96s,"This is the thing that the Diff is expected to be"
10m35.96s,10m37.36s,"But your Diffnet"
10m37.36s,10m39.32s,"So it looks like this in the Diff"
10m39.32s,10m41.28s,"That's what your Diff is"
10m41.28s,10m43.36s,"If you put this Unify as a 0"
10m43.36s,10m44.44s,"Basically"
10m44.44s,10m47.8s,"It will only show this red and green"
10m47.8s,10m48.92s,"We can try"
10m48.92s,10m53.64s,"Ok, there is a"
10m53.64s,10m55.68s,"There is a Diff thing on the Diff"
10m55.68s,10m57.12s,"Ok, anyway, this is"
10m57.12s,10m59.68s,"This parameter is basically to adjust"
10m59.68s,11m0.72s,"Can you think about it?"
11m0.72s,11m1.4s,"He adjusts it"
11m1.4s,11m5.04s,"Do you want to see the front row and the back row"
11m5.04s,11m6.44s,"The prediction is three rows"
11m6.44s,11m7.96s,"So basically you adjust it"
11m7.96s,11m9.36s,"We give it to token"
11m9.36s,11m10.68s,"We give it to OpenAI"
11m10.68s,11m12.48s,"You can reduce the token amount"
11m12.48s,11m14.48s,"So this is also the benefit of reducing the token amount"
11m14.48s,11m15.48s,"So if your"
11m15.48s,11m17.68s,"Your Ruminant is very long"
11m17.68s,11m18.88s,"Basically you can adjust it a little"
11m18.88s,11m20.72s,"It will save some tokens"
11m20.72s,11m22.72s,"Then basically I think you can set it as 0"
11m22.72s,11m23.56s,"Because"
11m23.56s,11m27.4s,"Basically OpenAI is looking at the front"
11m27.4s,11m27.96s,"These are the few"
11m27.96s,11m30.8s,"The whole answer to the back row is not very impressive"
11m30.8s,11m32.12s,"So basically I set it as 0"
11m32.12s,11m33.88s,"Ok"
11m33.88s,11m35.28s,"Then there is the Is Coolist"
11m35.28s,11m37.52s,"I think this is also very useful"
11m37.52s,11m39.2s,"What does this thing use"
11m39.2s,11m40.2s,"If you change things"
11m40.2s,11m42.76s,"For example, the package.json"
11m42.76s,11m44.96s,"The package is"
11m44.96s,11m45.8s,"NPN"
11m45.8s,11m46.56s,"NPN"
11m46.56s,11m47.52s,"ConfirDock.json"
11m47.52s,11m48.6s,"That actually doesn't use anything"
11m48.6s,11m50.12s,"Or the "go" in "go""
11m50.12s,11m52.04s,"For example, this "go go""
11m52.04s,11m53.68s,"This thing actually doesn't use anything"
11m53.68s,11m55.4s,"Then send it to OpenAI"
11m55.4s,11m56.88s,"It also saves the token amount"
11m56.88s,11m58.8s,"So basically I will choose this one"
11m58.8s,11m59.4s,"So"
11m59.4s,12m1.2s,"If it's similar, it's like this"
12m1.2s,12m3.6s,"Ok"
12m3.6s,12m5.12s,"For example, like this"
